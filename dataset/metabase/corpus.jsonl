The study design allows an escalation of the dose of ceralasertib in combination with the standard dose and schedule of either cytotoxic chemotherapies and/or novel anti-cancer agents, with intensive safety monitoring to ensure the safety of the patients. There are two parts to each combination module of this study; part A, dose escalation and an optional part B, cohort expansions in particular patient groups. The initial combination module will be with Carboplatin (module 1). The second combination will be with Olaparib (module 2). The third combination will be with durvalumab (module 3), the fourth combination will be AZD5305 (Module 5). The option to start further combination modules will be the decision of the Safety Review Committee (SRC), based on emerging preclinical data and, safety and tolerability information from the initial combination. Combinations of ceralasertib with novel anti-cancer agents may also be explored. Once a minimally biologically active dose of ceralasertib, for that combination module, has been identified from part A of that module, the SRC may decide to commence part B if deemed to be necessary. This may include cohort expansions of specific patient groups to explore preliminary anti-tumour activity or the effect of food or particular drug combinations on drug pharmacokinetics. The fourth module will investigate the effect of food on ceralasertib absorption and whether ceralasertib has an effect on QT.

{"_id": "NCT03767075", "title": "Basket of Baskets: A Modular, Open-label, Phase II, Multicentre Study To Evaluate Targeted Agents in Molecularly Selected Populations With Advanced Solid Tumours", "text": "Basket studies are a new sort of clinical studies to identify patients with the same kind of mutations and treat them with the same drug, irrespective of their specific cancer type. In basket studies, depending on the mutation types, patients are classified into \"baskets\". Targeted therapies that block that mutation are then identified and assigned to baskets where patients are treated accordingly.\n\nThis protocol has two parts: part A (iPROFILER), which includes the common procedures for tumor molecular profiling and treatment recommendation, and part B (iBASKET), which corresponds to the therapeutic portion.\n\nThe purpose of part A (iPROFILER) of this study is to test participants' tumour tissue in order to identify whether their tumour has certain mutations in cancer-related genes. It is known that gene mutations of tumours contribute to their origin and growth and determine whether the tumour will respond to particular cancer drugs. This test will provide information about potential targeted therapies that specifically attack those gene mutations. The purpose of part B (iBASKET) of this study is to offer participants a personalised anti-cancer treatment based on the gene mutations that are found in their tumour.\n\nParticipants taking part in module 1 of part B (iBASKET) will receive atezolizumab 1200 mg IV every 3 weeks, following the analysis of their tumour in part A (iPROFILER). Participants will be able to take atezolizumab for as long as their tumour doesn't grow and for as long as they don't have any side-effects which prevent them from continuing treatment. Module 1 will have a 2-year recruitment period. The aim of the study is to determine which genomically selected populations respond effectively to the targeted treatment, atezolizumab. Approximately 1000 participants will be enrolled into part A (iPROFILER), with approximately 120 participants being recruited into module 1 of part B (iBASKET).\n\nParticipants taking part in module 2 of part B (iBASKET) will receive will receive futibatinib, 20 mg, once daily (QD) in 28-day cycles, following the analysis of their tumour in part A (iPROFILER). Participants will be able to take futibatinib for as long as their tumour doesn't grow and for as long as they don't have any side-effects which prevent them from continuing treatment. Module 2 will have a 2-year recruitment period. The aim of the study is to determine which genomically selected populations respond effectively to the targeted treatment, futibatinib. Approximately 1000 participants will be enrolled into part A (iPROFILER), with approximately 80 participants being recruited into module 2 of part B (iBASKET).\n\nParticipants taking part in module 3 of part B (iBASKET) will receive amivantamab 1050 mg IV for body weight < 80 kg and 1400 mg for body weight >= 80 kg mg once weekly in Cycle 1 (with a split dose on Days 1-2) and then every 2 weeks in subsequent cycles (28-day cycles), following the analysis of their tumour in part A (iPROFILER). Participants will be able to take amivantamab for as long as their tumour doesn't grow and for as long as they don't have any side-effects which prevent them from continuing treatment. Module 3 will have a 2.5-year recruitment period. The aim of the study is to determine which genomically selected populations respond effectively to the targeted treatment, amivantamab. Approximately 1725 participants will be enrolled into part A (iPROFILER), with approximately 69 participants being recruited into module 3 of part B (iBASKET).

Cancer cells use PARP7 to hide from the immune system by stopping the cell from sending a signal (Type 1 interferon) that tells the immune system that something is wrong and to kill the cell. RBN-2397 has been shown in animal studies to inhibit tumor growth and also shuts down the \"don't kill me\" signal the tumor is sending to evade the immune system. As a PARP7 inhibitor RBN-2397 is different from drugs inhibiting PARP1, PARP2 and PARP3 enzymes which are approved for the treatment of certain ovarian and breast cancers.\n\nThe primary purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of orally administered RBN-2397 in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors. This study will also evaluate the safety and tolerability of RBN-2397, examine the pharmacokinetics (PK) (measure how the body absorbs, breaks down and eliminates RBN-2397) and investigate whether it has antitumor activity in solid tumor cancers."}}

NSCLC accounts for 85 percent (%) to 90% of lung cancers. Lazertinib is an oral, highly potent, mutant-selective, and irreversible EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) targeting both, the T790M mutation and activating EGFR mutations while sparing wild type EGFR. JNJ-61186372 (also referred to as amivantamab), is a low fucose, fully human immunoglobulin G1(IgG1)-based bispecific antibody. As a third generation EGFR-TKI targeting activating EGFR mutations, lazertinib has a distinct mechanism of action from JNJ-61186372, which targets the extracellular domains of both the EGFR and cMet proteins. The distinct mechanisms of action of lazertinib and JNJ-61186372 suggests potential to improve clinical outcomes through the combination of these two molecules.

This cell product consists of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL), which are collected from the patient and expanded in the lab under specific conditions to enhance its antitumoral efficacy before reinfusion in the same patient. However, this cell product alone does not achieve adequate efficacy, and a combination of both previous non-myeloablative lymphodepleting (NMA-LD) chemotherapy and subsequent cytokine therapy (specifically IL-2) is needed to support the expansion of the infused cells.\n\nThe investigators hypothesize that TILs enriched for neoantigen recognition are superior to unselected TILs at mediating tumor regression in patients with epithelial tumors and even other solid tumors where immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) is approved and used as part of standard therapy. The investigators propose to manufacture a T-cell product composed of TILs that are selected based on their ability to recognize patient-specific neoantigens and to use these to treat patients with metastatic, refractory, epithelial cancers, as well as ICB-resistant solid tumors. Furthermore, it also proposed to study the tumor and T cells at baseline and after treatment to investigate whether specific phenotypic and functional traits may be associated with clinical outcome.\n\nPrimary objective:\n\nTo evaluate the safety and the tolerability of ex vivo next generation neoantigen-selected Tumor-infiltrating Lymphocyte (TIL) in patients with metastatic or unresectable epithelial tumors and immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) resistant solid tumors.\n\nSecondary objectives:\n\nTo determine the success in producing active specific TILs from our target patients.\nTo evaluate the initial clinical activity of the NEXTGEN-TIL products in our target patients."}}

Approximately 60 patients with melanoma or SCCHN will be included (approximately 15 for each indication).During the neoadjuvant period, patients in cohort A, cohort B and Cohort C (Arm A) will receive IO102-IO103 and pembrolizumab KEYTRUDA® Q3W. Patients in Cohort C (Arm B) will receive pembrolizumab KEYTRUDA® Patients with melanoma will receive 3 doses of neoadjuvant treatment. Patients with SCCHN will receive 2 or 3 doses of neoadjuvant treatment, at the investigator's discretion. Surgical resection will be performed 1 to 3 weeks after the last dose of neoadjuvant treatment. All patients in cohort A,B and Cohort C (Arm A)will receive post-surgery treatment with IO102-IO103 and pembrolizumab KEYTRUDA® for a total of 15 cycles (up to 45 weeks). Patients in Cohort C (Arm B) will receive post-surgery treatment with pembrolizumab KEYTRUDA® for a total of 15 cycles (up to 45 weeks).\n\nPatients with melanoma and patients with SCCHN who do not require SOC RT ± cisplatin will start post-surgery treatment after adequate recovery from surgery (approximately 1 to 2 months; no more than 12 weeks).Patients with SCCHN who require postoperative SOC therapy after surgery will start post-surgery IO102-IO103 and pembrolizumab KEYTRUDA® after adequate recovery from SOC therapy (approximately 1 to 2 months; no more than 12 weeks).\n\nObjective response will be based on imaging; pathologic tumor response of the surgical specimens will be assessed at the time of surgery. Safety will be assessed by recording adverse events. The primary endpoint will be the percentage of patients with major pathologic response (MPR) in the resected tumor tissue after neoadjuvant treatment. Secondary endpoints include disease-free survival (DFS) at 2 years after surgery. All patients will have an end-of-treatment visit approximately 4 weeks after their last dose of trial treatment.

Standard treatment consists of concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) with cisplatin. In spite of many clinical trials and meta-analyses, the improvement of patient outcomes with the use of induction chemotherapy (IC) hasn´t been clearly demonstrated, partially due to the high toxicity of the standard TPF (docetaxel+cisplatin+fluorouracil) regimen used most frequently in this setting. Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate the outcomes of patients with LASCCHN treated with a less toxic induction mTPF regimen followed by CCRT.\n\nThe study will include patients with LASCCHN who - by the decision of the multidisciplinary team - have been assigned treatment with IC followed by CCRT. After being informed about the study objectives and potential risks, all patients giving written informed consent and meeting all the eligibility criteria will start the treatment. According to the study protocol, participants will receive 4 cycles of induction mTPF regimen repeated every 2 weeks followed by computed tomography (CT) response evaluation. 3-6 weeks after having completed the last cycle of mTPF, patients without disease progression will start CCRT with 2 cycles of cisplatin every 3 weeks.

This study focuses on certain types of skin cancer, kidney cancer, stomach cancer, and lung cancer.\n\nThe study treatment BAY2965501 is currently under development as monotherapy or in combination with a drug named pembrolizumab for the treatment of people with advanced solid tumors.\n\nBAY2965501 blocks an enzyme in T-cells to activate them. T-cells are a type of immune cell that are known to have an anti-cancer effect and BAY2965501 is a potential new immunotherapy.\n\nThe main purpose of this first-in-human study is to learn:\n\nhow safe different doses of BAY2965501 are when given as a single drug or in combination,\nthe degree to which medical problems caused by BAY2965501 when given as a single drug or in combination, can be tolerated (also called tolerability),\nwhat maximum amount can be given as a single drug or in combination, and\nhow it moves into, through and out of the body as a single drug or in combination.\n\nTo answer this, researchers will look at:\n\nthe number and severity of medical problems participants have after taking BAY2965501 as a single drug or in combination for each dose level. These medical problems are also referred to as adverse events.\nthe (average) total level of BAY2965501 in the blood (also called AUC) after intake of single and multiple doses\nthe (average) highest level of BAY2965501 in the blood (also called Cmax) after intake of single and multiple doses Doctors keep track of all medical problems that participants have during the study, even if they do not think the medical problem might be related to the study treatment.\n\nIn addition, the researchers want to know if and how the participants' tumors change after taking BAY2965501.\n\nThe study will have two parts. The first part, called dose escalation, is done to find the most appropriate dose that can be given in the second part. For this, participants will be assigned to receive one of the planned doses and schedules of BAY2965501 as single drug or participants will be assigned to one of the increasing doses of BAY2965501 in combination with 200mg pembrolizumab. All participants will take BAY2965501 by mouth. Additionally, in the combination group, pembrozilumab will be given.\n\nIn the second part, called dose expansion, all participants in the single drug group will receive up to 2 of the most appropriate doses of BAY2965501 from the 1st part as tablet by mouth. The participants in the combination group will receive the most appropriate dose of BAY2965501 from the first part.\n\nParticipants in both parts of the study, will take the study treatment until the tumor gets worse (also known as 'disease progression'), or until the participants have medical problems. In general, the study treatment is planned for a maximum of 35 cycles.\n\nEach participant will be in the study for several months, including a screening phase of up to 28 days, few months of treatment depending on the participant's benefit, and a follow up phase after the end of treatment. The following approximate numbers of visits to the study site are planned: two during the screening phase, six in the first treatment month, one to three per month in the following periods.\n\nParticipants in part two will be assigned to one of 3 groups depending on cancer characteristics.\n\nStudy procedures described below may vary between these groups.\n\nDuring the study, the study team will:\n\ntake blood and urine samples\ndo physical examinations\ncheck vital signs such as blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature\nexamine heart health using ECG (electrocardiogram)\ncheck if the participants' cancer has grown and/or spread using CT (computed tomography) or MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) and, if needed, bone scan\ntake tumor samples (if required)\n\nThe treatment period ends with a visit no later than 7 days after the last BAY2965501 dose in the single drug and combination group. About 30 and 90 days after the last dose and every 12 weeks thereafter, the study team will check the participants' health and any changes in cancer. This follow-up period ends with worsening of the cancer, start of new anti-cancer therapy, or until the participant leaves the study. In addition, the study doctors and their team will contact the participant every 12 weeks to learn about the participant's survival. This ends no later than 12 months after the last participant started treatment or by the end of the study, whichever comes first."}}
