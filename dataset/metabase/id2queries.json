She has developed metastasis, including brain metastasis, but no metastasis to the liver or bones. The cancer has spread to the lymph nodes. She has undergone one treatment in the metastatic setting, specifically with Pembrolizumab. Her daily activities are slightly restricted, but she is able to perform light work. She has not undergone any major surgery or transplant in the last four weeks and her blood test values are within normal ranges.",
