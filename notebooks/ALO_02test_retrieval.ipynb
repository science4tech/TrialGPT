Specifically, the study will evaluate the change in IML following a 2-hour training run and the recovery of IML in response to the post-exercise low-fat or moderate-fat diet in 10 endurance trained athletes who will consume both diets in a randomly assigned cross-over fashion. We hypothesize that IML will be depleted with prolonged endurance exercise, and that replenishment of IML will be impaired by an extremely low-fat diet compared to a moderate-fat diet. Results of this pilot study will be used to apply for extramural grant support from NIH or the US Armed Forces to investigate the effect of dietary fat on the health and performance of individuals performing heavy physical training. It is anticipated that this methodology could also be employed in obesity research to delineate, longitudinally, the reported cross-sectional relationships among IML stores, insulin resistance and obesity.'},\n",

       "  'brief_summary': \"Background:~Cancer has an enormous impact on the psychological and social well-being of the family unit. The life-threatening connotations of cancer single out the ill child from his peer/family group as one who is different, and often unable to maintain a normal lifestyle. Physical sequelae of cancer and its treatment accentuate the differences between these children and their normal peers/siblings.~It is important that children with cancer be prepared to function outside of protected situations and begin to develop skills of separation and independence. For healthy children, some of these latter skills are acquired by a camping experience. Such an experience for the patient with cancer is frequently precluded by their dependence on medical facilities and the physical limitations of their activities.~The goal of this study will be to assess the short and long term benefits of the normalized camping experience, provided in conjunction with Special Love, Inc., on the patients and staff. In particular, we will seek to determine whether such a comprehensive experience is capable of influencing the attitudes and life experiences of patients and staff in a positive manner.~Objectives:~-To evaluate the impact of an enriched normalized camping experience on the quality of life of the pediatric cancer patient. In particular, attempts will be made to measure the manner in which this experience influences the child's sense of well-being and self-esteem as well as his or her relationship with parents, family, and peers.~Eligibility:~Children 7-17 years of age who are currently being treated for cancer or are up to 3 years post therapy OR Young adults with cancer (YACers) 18-25 years of age who are acting as counselors at Camp Fantastic~All children/young adults will be selected for camp after careful screening by a multidisciplinary committee consisting of medical and program directors.~At the discretion of the multidisciplinary committee consisting of medical and program directors, special exceptions may be made for children with extenuating circumstances.~Design:~Assessment of benefit may include interviews with children and families before, during and following camp. Observational data on the child's performance at camp will be noted.~Medical and nursing personnel will consist of staff from the Pediatric Branch at the NCI, other units within the NIH, and participating institutions.~Special Love members, the Program Director at the 4-H Center camp (site of the camp) and Pediatric Branch staff at the NCI will coordinate the camp program, taking into account the medical needs of each camper.~Every attempt will be made to provide a full agenda of age appropriate activities for the patients.~The length of the camping experience for children with cancer will be for 7 days beginning on a Sunday and extending through the following Saturday morning.

       "  'brief_summary': 'Our laboratory has previously demonstrated that lymph nodes are a major reservoir for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and a major site of active virus replication in infected individuals. There is at least a 10 fold greater viral burden per given number of CD4+ T lymphocytes obtained from the lymph nodes versus the peripheral blood in the same infected individual. These data have been accumulated predominantly in individuals with progressive generalized lymphadenopathy (CDC Class A1 and A2). It is unclear at present whether this pattern holds true for all categories of HIV infected individuals. We have proposed that the seeding of lymph nodes by HIV early in the course of HIV infection and the persistent production of virus in lymph nodes throughout the course of infection are major factors in the pathogenesis of HIV in virtually all infected individuals. In addition, it is likely that the selective perturbations of various T cell subsets (i.e., V-B classes of CD4+T cells) that have been observed in peripheral blood are much more dramatic in the lymph node given the greater viral burden in the lymph node compared to the peripheral blood. In order to investigate this hypothesis, it is essential that we study simultaneously lymph nodes and peripheral blood from the same individuals and that we study different individuals at various stages of disease from early in the course of infection (CDC Class A) to advanced disease (CDC Class B and C). If, as we suspect, there is active virus replication in the lymph node early in the course of infection, even at a time when there is little virus burden or active replication in the peripheral blood, this would justify anti-retroviral therapy at the earliest possible time in the course of infection. In addition, in certain patients who are about to initiate treatment with an anti-retroviral agent such as zidovudine or didanosine through their private physician, it would be important to know whether treatment actually reduces the viral burden and virus replication in lymph nodes. The effect of therapy on viral burden and replication will be compared in the lymph node versus peripheral blood mononuclear cells and both of these parameters will be compared with the level of plasma viremia.'},\n",

This protocol will encompass studies of the natural history, pathogenesis and treatment of these chronic kidney disorders. It will also allow us to: (1) provide second opinions to referring physicians about management of subjects with these relatively rare kidney diseases; (2) collect research samples (e.g., blood), urine, and kidney tissue obtained from clinically-indicated or from research renal biopsies); (3) and treat these subjects with standard or other approved therapies; or (4) invite selected subjects patients to participate in limited pilot studies of novel combinations of standard therapeutic agents, such as rituximab and cyclosporine. (5) Agricultural worker chronic kidney disease of undetermined etiology (CKDu) is a growing problem in tropical countries in the Americas and Asia, including Sri Lanka where collaborators are located. We will receive kidney tissue from 25 CKDu cases for pathologic examination and transcriptional profiling and blood, plasma, serum, urine for metabolomic and genetic analysis from 50 cases and controls. Subjects were consented and samples were collected under a protocol approved by the University of Colombo IRB. These studies may provide the opportunity to generate new hypotheses regarding pathogenesis and treatment that would be candidates for testing in other research protocols.~Subjects with known or suspected forms of sclerosing glomerular or chronic, fibrosing tubulointerstitial kidney diseases will undergo routine medical evaluation, laboratory testing, imaging procedures and kidney biopsies as medically indicated. Selected subjects will be invited to provide informed consent to undergo a kidney biopsy for research purposes. Blood, urine, and tissue samples will be evaluated both for standard diagnostic purposes and for research purposes using specialized molecular methods that may provide insights into specific disease pathogenesis. Subjects may elect to receive the results of their kidney disease evaluation, NIH treatment recommendations, and return to the care of their referring physicians.

The purpose of this pilot study is to evaluate the effect of exercise intensity on the time constant describing changes in VO2 (tauVO2) during recovery from one minute of constant work rate exercise. Five normal healthy volunteers ages 18 and older will perform a progressive maximal aerobic exercise test, using a cycle ergometer, to determine VO2max and lactate threshold (LT) estimated by gas exchange. Each subject will also complete a series of maximal constant work rate tests and submaximal constant work rate tests at 80% LT and 50% of the difference between LT and VO2max (50% delta). Breath by breath variability and VO2 span will be used to determine the number of constant work rate test repetitions, for each subject for each exercise intensity, needed to establish confidence in tauVO2. A mean response profile of VO2 recovery kinetics for each exercise intensity will be analyzed using non-linear regression to determine tauVO2. To examine the effect of exercise intensity on tauVO2, one way analysis of variance will be used to determine whether differences exist among maximal and submaximal (80% LT and 50% delta) time constants. We hypothesize that there will be no significant differences among time constants for VO2 during recovery from maximal and submaximal constant work rate exercise lasting one minute.

Cancer patients undergoing Phase I therapy on clinical trials constitute a special population of patients, since by definition, their prescribed therapy is scientifically unproven in terms of efficacy. Phase I patients are closely monitored for adverse effects in order to identify and characterize the toxicities and to define a tolerable dose of their experimental treatment. Thus, the unrecognized use of alternative therapies by patients actively enrolled in phase I trials may potentially confound rational drug development by causing adverse side effects or by contributing to drug interactions. Examples of clinical toxicities induced by alternative medical treatments include liver dysfunction or renal failure caused by herbal preparations, or hematologic abnormalities, such as eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome caused by tryptophan food supplements. Therefore, it is important to document and determine the prevalence of alternative therapy use in this specific patient population; however, this issue has not previously been examined in a scientifically rigorous manner. We propose to conduct a survey and interview study of phase I cancer patients enrolled in ongoing clinical trials at the National Cancer Institute to determine the prevalence of alternative therapy use in this population. This study will also examine patient attitudes and perceptions regarding their use of alternative therapy as compared with their scientifically-sanctioned phase I experimental therapy.

EDHF is produced by the cells that line blood vessels.~Normal volunteers between the ages of 21 to 60 may participate in this study. Candidates will be screened for eligibility with a medical history, physical examination, electrocardiogram and routine laboratory tests. Those enrolled will be injected with miconazole to study its effects on blood vessels.~Study participants will take three aspirin tablets. After administration of a local anesthetic, small tubes will be inserted through a needle into the artery and vein of the forearm. These will be used to measure blood pressure and to draw blood samples during the study. Forearm blood flow will be measured using pressure cuffs placed on the wrist and upper arm, and a strain gauge (a rubber band device) placed around the forearm. When the cuffs are inflated, blood will flow into the arm, stretching the strain gauge, and the flow measurement will be recorded.~Small doses of four drugs-bradykinin, sodium nitroprusside, miconazole, and LNMMA-will be given through the arterial catheter. Bradykinin stimulates the release of EDHF and can lower blood pressure. Sodium nitroprusside causes blood vessels to dilate and is used to treat high blood pressure and heart failure. Miconazole is commonly prescribed to treat various infections, including vaginal yeast infections, jock itch and athlete's foot. In much higher doses, it is used to treat fungal infections that have spread to the lungs, brain, kidneys, or bladder. LNMMA inhibits production of nitric oxide, another substance produced by the lining cells of blood vessels.~Blood flow will be measured throughout the study, which will last approximately 3 hours.\"},\n",

       "  'brief_summary': 'The purpose of this investigation is to develop improved magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques and hardware for studying brain function. MRI is a diagnostic tool that provides information about brain chemistry and physiology. This study will evaluate new MRI methods for monitoring blood flow to regions of the brain in response to simple tasks. The MRI machine used in this study is more powerful than those in most hospitals, permitting a higher visual resolution.~Normal healthy volunteers over 18 years old may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with a medical history and questionnaire, and a neurological examination. Study participants will have a yearly MRI scan. For this procedure, the subject lies on a stretcher that is moved into a donut-shaped machine with a strong magnetic field. A lightweight circular or rectangular coil a device that improves the quality of the images may be placed on the head. The scan time varies from 20 minutes to 3 hours; most scans last between 45 and 90 minutes. During the scan, the subject may perform simple tasks, such as listening to tapes, tapping a finger, moving a hand, watching a screen, or smelling a fragrance. More complex tasks may require thinking about tones or pictures and responding to them by pressing buttons.~Information from this study will be used to develop better imaging methods that will, in turn, permit a greater understanding of normal and abnormal brain behaviors.'},\n",

Women who are recently menopausal (50-60 yrs. of age) and over 20 years postmenopausal (>70 yrs. of age) will take estrogen or placebo for three months. At the end of that time they will participate in three challenges using dietary techniques to briefly change the relative amounts of neurotransmitters in the brain that are believed to be related to mood regulation (serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine). Previous research has shown that these dietary manipulations can briefly produce negative changes in mood. The investigator hypothesizes that estrogen administration will blunt or buffer these negative effects in a quantifiable way. The investigator believes that this will provide a direct test of the ability of estrogen to meaningfully change the brain chemistry of mood in a clinically measurable and positive way. The proposed procedure will also allow assessment of the effects of estrogen on brain neurotransmitter systems after many years of very low estrogen levels.'},\n",

De qi can be perceived by the acupuncturist in the form of needle grasp, a mechanical gripping of the needle by the tissue. De qi is considered essential to the therapeutic effect of acupuncture. Therefore, the investigator proposes that understanding this local tissue reaction will lead to an understanding of how the therapeutic effect of acupuncture therapy arises. Specifically, it is hypothesized that needle manipulation causes winding of collagen and elastic fibers around the needle. This action induces tension in the collagen network surrounding the needling site and results in a mechanical signal that is transduced into local cells. The objective of the current work is to use ultrasound elastography, a recently developed ultrasound imaging technique, to visualize and quantify changes in the elastic properties of skin and subcutaneous tissue in 12 healthy human volunteers as a result of acupuncture needle manipulation.'},\n",

Successful transplantation of clusters (islets) of normal cells, that include those which produce the sugar-lowering hormone insulin, from the pancreas of a person who did not have diabetes into a person with diabetes should eliminate high blood sugar levels. We wish to determine if it will also eliminate low blood sugar. To do so we will give insulin to lower the blood sugar, measure the levels of the hormones that normally raise blood sugar levels (e.g., glucagon and epinephrine) and then stop the insulin and see if blood sugar levels return to normal. Because we anticipate that the transplanted islets will produce insulin, but not glucagon, this study may also tell us if regulated insulin production alone can prevent hypoglycemia in humans.'},\n",

This and other low-carbohydrate diets, such as the ZONE, Sugar Busters, and the Carbohydrate Addicts Diet, have attracted much popular attention but little scientific evaluation. Given the widespread use of these diets, it seems prudent to evaluate them both for safety and efficacy. Therefore, the purpose of the study is to compare the effectiveness of two different weight control programs over the course of 52 weeks. These two programs are 1) the Atkins' New Diet Revolution, a low-carbohydrate, high-protein diet, and 2) Brownell's LEARN Program, a high carbohydrate, low fat diet based on behavior modification. Specifically, this study will compare short-term changes in weight, food intake, blood chemistries and mood in adult males (n=10) and females (n=10) who are randomized to either the Atkins' Diet or the LEARN Program for a period of one year. During this year, they will be under medical supervision. We will examine the effect of the two weight loss plans on changes in lipids, blood pressure, insulin sensitivity and ketones, and eating behavior. This is a feasibility study and thus the data will ultimately be used to design a large randomized trial with adequate statistical power.\"},\n",

For example, visual scenes contain many different objects that cannot be processed simultaneously because of the limited processing capacity of the brain's visual system. Evidence suggests that a a network of brain regions selects relevant information and filters out irrelevant information when people view cluttered visual scenes. This study will use transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to determine how the different brain regions involved in attentional control and filtering interact.~Participants in this study will undergo computer tests, an MRI scan, and TMS. During the MRI, participants will look at pictures and count objects appearing on a screen. During the TMS, participants will perform a computer test.

Preliminary research indicates that this supplement can speed the metabolism of the anti-seizure drug Tegretol, causing reduced blood levels of the drug. Patients who take Tegretol to control their seizures may have more frequent seizures if the blood level of the drug drops too low. A recent study shows that this effect is not seen when Tegretol is taken for at least 3 weeks. The present study will examine whether there is a medically important drug interaction between St. John's wort and Tegretol when Tegretol is taken for 1 day.~Normal healthy volunteers between 21 and 65 years old who are not taking medicines that can affect the metabolism of drugs in the liver and have not used St. John's wort for at least 30 days may be eligible for this 25-day study.~Participants will take a 400-mg dose of Tegretol after fasting overnight. Blood samples will be drawn the next day during a 12-hour clinic stay at the following intervals: just before the Tegretol dose and at 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 24, 34, 48 and 72 hours after the dose. A catheter will be placed in the vein to prevent the need for multiple needle sticks until after the 10-hour sample. After completing the blood sampling, participants will take 300 mg of St. John's wort 3 times a day with meals for 2 weeks. After 2 weeks, another fasting dose of Tegretol will be given and the 72-hour blood study will be repeated.~This study may provide information important for the care of patients with epilepsy who take both Tegretol and St. John's Wort.\"},\n",

They will bring the urine samples to the Clinical Center when the collection is complete. This procedure will be repeated 1 week later (study day 8). After the second urine collection is completed, subjects will take 200 milligrams of kava 3 times a day for 21 days. On study day 29 (after 21 days of kava), subjects will repeat the dextromethorphan and caffeine dosing and urine collection described above, while continuing to take kava.~Subjects will have an electroencephalograph (EEG) done before starting kava and again at the end of kava (study day 30). For this procedure, several electrodes (metal cups attached to wires) are secured to the scalp with a glue-like substance. A conductive gel fills the space between the electrode and the scalp to ensure good contact. The electrodes will remain in place for about 2 hours and then removed.

       "  'brief_summary': \"This study will test the safety of an experimental vaccine against HIV and will examine whether it causes an immune response to HIV virus proteins. A vaccine is given to try to create resistance or immunity to a disease or infection. The vaccine in this study is made from DNA (genetic material) of two HIV proteins called gag and pol. Injected into a human, the viral DNA instructs the body to make small amounts of some HIV proteins. This study will see if the body then creates an immune response to these proteins. Study participants cannot catch HIV or AIDS from the DNA vaccine or proteins that may be made from it.~Healthy normal volunteers between 18 and 60 years of age may be eligible for this study. Candidates will provide a medical history, including information on sexual activity and drug use. They will have a physical examination, blood tests, urine test and chest X-ray. All candidates enrolled in the study must use a barrier method of contraception for sexual intercourse from the start of the study until 3 months after the last vaccination.~Participants will be assigned to one of two treatment groups: one will receive the experimental vaccine; the other will receive a control substance (inactive salt solution). The first five people assigned to the vaccine group will receive the lowest study dose of the vaccine. If this dose is safe, it will be increased three times for the next group of five and then eight times for the last group of five. Each group will have a total of seven people - five will receive the vaccine and two will get the salt solution.~Before the first injection, and possibly the second and third, a catheter (thin plastic tube) will be placed into a vein so that treatment can be given quickly if there is a reaction to the vaccine. Participants will receive three injections in an upper arm muscle-one injection a month for three months-with a needle-less device called a Biojector. For each injection, the volunteer will~be observed for at least 1 hour after immunization~record temperature and symptoms, including any effects at the injection site, for 2 days and report them to the clinic staff~immediately report any side effects to a study physician or nurse.~Volunteers will have physical examinations and laboratory tests at certain times while they receive the vaccine and for a period afterwards. These procedures will require about 14 clinic visits of about 1 to 2 hours each, and up to 6 hours on vaccination days. Blood will be drawn at all visits. Some of the blood will be used for genetic tests, and some will be stored for future tests of the immune system and the body's response to the study vaccine. The study will last about 12 months from the date of the first injection. After it is completed, clinic staff may contact volunteers once or twice a year for at least 3 years to follow up.\"},\n",

       "  'brief_summary': \"Analgesics and sedatives administered to control distress from minimally invasive surgical procedures have limited effectiveness and serious side effects. Unabated distress not only interferes with smooth progression of the ongoing procedure, but can elicit adverse responses when patients need additional intervention. The long-term objective of this research is to provide a safe and practical behavioral method for reducing cognitive and physiologic distress associated with invasive procedures. Currently, this method should benefit at least 8 million patients annually in the US. Extrapolating the risk of intravenous conscious sedation to the number of invasive procedures performed annually, we predict that 47,000 patients will suffer serious cardiorespiratory complications and 2,600 will die. These numbers do not include effects of the psychological damage inflicted by poorly managed procedure-related stress on patients' subsequent health behavior. This application sets out to pursue three aims: 1) Prospectively determine the impact of self-hypnotic relaxation on cognitive and physiologic distress during tumor embolizations; 2) Prospectively determine the impact of self-hypnotic relaxation on distress in the postoperative period; 3) Determine the impact of intraprocedural self-hypnotic relaxation on distress during subsequent tumor embolization. We hypothesize that: 1) Self-hypnotic relaxation decreases cognitive and physiologic distress during tumor embolizations. 2) Self-hypnotic relaxation decreases cognitive and physiologic distress after tumor embolization when post-embolization ischemia is expected to induce painful stimuli and systemic distress. 3) The beneficial effect of self-hypnotic coping skills acquired during an invasive procedure carries over to the next invasive procedure. Upon completion, the efficacy and durability of procedural administration of nonpharmacologic analgesia will be known by a rigorous and practical assessment. The relative performance of self-hypnotic relaxation will be quantified compared to standard care and empathic controls in a well-characterized population of patients within the controlled and monitored environment of a busy interventional radiology practice. Results from this competing renewal will provide the next level of data needed for future study design to determine broad clinical utility in a multicenter randomized controlled trial.\"},\n",

A variety of methods have been designed to optimize the use of specialty expertise including practice guidelines and disease management approaches as well as the consultation/referral process. The referral-consultation process is an important mechanism for obtaining clinically useful information. At one end of the spectrum of this process, informal consultation involves discussion about a patient with a colleague without the consultant seeing the patient; at the other end of the spectrum, care of the patient is transferred to another physician and the process is formalized. Because much specialist expertise resides in the specialists themselves, the expansion of primary care sites to include community-based outpatient clinics has implications for access to the specialists located elsewhere. This study was designed to evaluate a computer-assisted voice mail system which is relatively inexpensive and more convenient than video-telemedicine systems, making it more practical and more easily exportable. Diabetes care delivery was chosen as the model in which to assess informal consultation based on its frequency among veterans, management challenges, and the emphasis on improvement in diabetes care in VA. A secondary goal of the project was to better characterize the consultation process.'},\n",

Reduction in smoking during pregnancy could result in significant improvements in pregnancy outcomes and reducing the cost of health care. There is evidence that low-intensity pregnancy smoking cessation programs may be inadequate for women who are more addicted, and at educational and economic disadvantage. Motivational enhancement strategies have shown considerable promise in the treatment of addictive behaviors. Physiological feedback highlighting prenatal effects of smoking and benefits of cessation has been found to enhance prenatal smoking cessation counseling. An intervention that combines motivational enhancement counseling and physiological feedback may have powerful effects beyond low-intensity interventions or usual counseling.'},\n",

However, the need to use 2 or more donor pancreases to achieve freedom from insulin shots limits the widespread use of this protocol. Two classes of oral antidiabetic drugs improve insulin action and reduce the amount of insulin needed to have normal blood sugars. The first part of the proposed project (Group 1) will use these drugs in conjunction with the Edmonton Protocol to allow for successful islet transplantation from islets isolated from a single pancreas.~The Edmonton Protocol is a treatment, not a cure. It requires the long-term use of powerful immunosuppressive drugs that are expensive and increase the risk of infection and cancer. T1DM patients who have a functioning kidney transplant already have to use immunosuppressive drugs, and they are still at risk of recurrent diabetic kidney disease and other complications of diabetes. Islet transplantation in these patients has only rarely been successful in the past in part because the usual immunosuppressive drugs used in kidney transplantation cause diabetes and actually harm the transplant kidney in other ways. The immunosuppressive drugs used in the Edmonton Protocol are less likely to cause diabetes and are also less harmful to the kidney. In the second part of this project (Group 2), we will transplant islets into kidney transplant patients after they have switched to the immunosuppressive medications used in the Edmonton Protocol. Even if some of the patients do not get islet transplants or still need insulin shots after islet transplantation, we expect to see improvement in kidney function and blood glucose control.'},\n",

Raf-1 is a protein produced by human cells, both normal and cancerous, which may help protect tumor cells from radiation. Antisense oligonucleotides are very specific drugs, which can decrease the amount of a certain target protein by blocking the gene that makes it. Antisense oligonucleotide to raf gene can reduce the amount of Raf-1 protein in tumor cells. Liposomes are tiny globules of fat, which can carry drugs in the body. The experimental agent LErafAON is composed of liposomes carrying antisense oligonucleotide against the Raf-1 protein. It is hoped that decreased Raf-1 in the cancer cells will make them more sensitive to the radiation therapy.~Patients with advanced solid tumors will receive IV infusions of LErafAON over at least 60 minutes, once per week, for 8 weeks. In the absence of progression, patients may continue on weekly treatment. Pre-medications will be administered prior to each dose of study medication.~Cohorts of at least three patients will be entered at escalating dose-levels.

This fiberoptic coupled dosimetry system is a new and innovative technology application which allows on-line measurement of instantaneous dose rate and total dose never before achievable. It offers a clear advantage in patient treatment delivery, allowing on-line corrections essential to a new generation of radiotherapy treatment machines with development of beam intensity modulation as an adjunct to 3D conformal therapy. It also has the advantage of submillimeter size and is minimally invasive, making it ideal for brachytherapy.~This system has the potential for stable, accurate, reproducible, clinically feasible measurements of total dose and dose rate. The output of this system will be measured under various clinical conditions encountered in a clinical setting and compared against existing thermolumeniscent and diode dosimetry standards. Initial measurements will use a tissue equivalent phantom for depth dose and accuracy measurements.

Meals may be eaten at the NIH Clinical Center, or packaged meals prepared by the Nutrition Department can be taken out. Participants may not engage in any heavy exercise during the diet periods, as exercise affects nitric oxide levels.~Blood samples of about 4 milliliters, or 1 teaspoon, each will be collected before starting each diet and at the end of each diet to measure blood levels of nitrate and nitrite. Additional blood samples, totaling about 2 tablespoons, will be collected for research. Each day, participants will have a test to measure exhaled nitric oxide levels. This involves blowing air into a mouthpiece attached to a machine that measures levels of the gas in each breath.\"},\n",

In other cases, the subject may have a feeling of movement or feel a tingling sensation in a limb. Stimulation over the muscles on the side of the head may cause some discomfort in that area or twitching of the jaw.~During the stimulation, the subject may be asked to tense certain muscles slightly or perform other simple actions. The electrical activity of the muscles activated by the stimulation will be recorded using metal electrodes taped to the skin over the muscle. In most cases, the study takes less than 3 hours.'},\n",

Compliance is problematic in that estimates show only 1/3 of women use hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and only 30% are compliant. Estrogen has many documented benefits including symptomatic relief of hot flashes, improvement of the dry vagina and dyspareunia. Estrogen has been found to improve bone mineral density and increase the high- density lipoprotein portion of a cholesterol panel. To improve compliance and to provide an alternate method of delivery, we propose the use of estrogen which is admixed in toothpaste and propose to study the absorption, rate of build-up and rate of decline.~Hypothesis: Estrogen can potentially be absorbed systemically when toothpaste is admixed with estradiol and is applied in a timed, consistent fashion to postmenopausal or surgically postmenopausal women, not on HRT. Absorption takes place across the buccal mucosa.~Specific Aims:1) To estimate the systemic absorption of estrogen from daily use of estrogen containing toothpaste.~2) To estimate the rate of build-up of serum estrogen levels based upon daily use of toothpaste containing estrogen for eight days.~3) To estimate the rate of decline in serum estrogen levels when the use of estrogen containing toothpaste is discontinued for a week.'},\n",

       "  'brief_summary': 'Most clinicians who care for patients with inflammatory airway diseases such as allergic rhinitis and asthma are aware of the negative effects of certain sights, sounds and smells that can precipitate clinical exacerbations in certain susceptible patients. This is thought to be due to subconscious associations between these observable stimuli paired and actual exposure to allergens that induce clinical symptoms. The severity and duration of these symptoms are typically related to levels of anxiety and/or depression in affected patients. Classical conditioning of the immune response has been described in many animal and some human studies in association with administration of immunosuppressive drugs. In successfully conditioned individuals, subsequent exposure to the conditioning stimulus alone produces immunosuppressive changes similar to those caused by the drugs themselves. Since disease exacerbating conditioning appears to be prevalent in allergic patients, these conditions make an excellent human model for understanding the relationships between classical conditioning, psychological stress (particularly anxiety and depression) and immune regulation. Thus this proposal will seek to examine the hypothesis that antiinflammatory effects of pharmacotherapeutic agents can be classically conditioned and are clinically effective due to changes in immunoregulatory imbalances known to occur in patients with allergic airway diseases. The effectiveness of this therapeutic approach will be significantly affected by levels of psychological stress and individual suggestibility. This will be investigated with the following Specific Aims: (1). Determine the relative effectiveness of classical conditioning by a novel gustatory stimulus paired with immunosuppressive doses of corticosteroid on in vivo and in vitro immune responses (allergen - specific vs. general) of patients before, during and after classical conditioning correlated with level of clinical response; (2) Determine the role of neuroendocrine mechanisms (particularly catecholamines) on the inducibility and duration of the conditioned immune responses; and (3) Investigate the influence of psychological stress levels (including anxiety and depression) and/or suggestibility on baseline immune changes, success and duration of the classical conditioning.~These data will help define parameters for classical conditioning in humans, establish a model to investigate mechanisms and serve as the basis for development of future interventional protocols for severe inflammatory diseases involving classical conditioning.'},\n",

The drug is given either intravenously (through a vein) twice a day or by mouth 3 times a day. Valganciclovir is converted to ganciclovir in the body and is absorbed into the bloodstream better than oral ganciclovir. In most transplant patients, a single daily dose of valganciclovir prevents CMV. Because of these advantages, some transplant patients are being given valganciclovir instead of ganciclovir to prevent CMV infection. However, the drug has not been studied in kidney and kidney transplant patients. This study will provide dosing information for this patient population.~Patients 18 years of age and older who have had a kidney or kidney and pancreas transplant at the NIH Clinical Center may be eligible for this study.

Our long range goal is to determine whether other hormones (e.g., combined testosterone and growth hormone) are helpful as an adjunct to traditional rehabilitation therapy.~This project is important to the VA health care system because 38% of American veterans are aged (age > 65 years), bioavailable testosterone is diminished in older age men, low testosterone is associated with impaired muscle strength, and lack of muscle strength hinders rehabilitation. Older men who are not successfully rehabilitated often get admitted to nursing homes for long term care, at a cost of approximately $40,000/year. Payment for long term care is currently one of our most difficult health care problems. If testosterone supplementation improves rehabilitation outcomes, as our pilot data suggest it will, patients will be more satisfied and long-term care financial resources will be saved.~We will conduct a randomized, placebo-controlled trial to test the hypothesis that supplementation with testosterone improves rehabilitation outcomes in deconditioned older men. Specifically, we will screen all hospitalized older men with delayed discharge from the hospital (> 7 day hospital stay). Men who have at least one new impairment in their ability to perform activities of daily living (e.g., inability to walk), low serum testosterone concentration, and no contraindications (e.g., prostate or breast cancer) will be offered the opportunity to participate. Study participants will be randomized to receive either testosterone (5 mg transdermally each night) or placebo (matching transdermal patch) daily in a double-blind fashion for the duration of their hospital course (expected average duration of study is 29 days). Subjects will then receive their rehabilitation as usual, with all members of the health care team blinded as to whether the subject is receiving testosterone or placebo. At baseline, weekly, at discharge, and at 6 and 12 months after discharge, subjects will be assessed using validated measures (i.e., Functional Independence Measure - FIM). Our hypothesis is that testosterone supplementation, as an adjunct to traditional rehabilitation therapy, will improve rehabilitation outcomes.'},\n",

Our general hypothesis is that patients will benefit from rehabilitation that occurs simultaneously with the medical management of acute conditions and when linked with a home exercise program that can be implemented after discharge from the hospital. This approach differs from the traditional approach of addressing rehabilitation needs after acute conditions have resolved and providing rehabilitation services for selected patients in institutional settings, such as subacute units or nursing homes. The feasibility of the program will be assessed by documenting the participation of subjects during the inpatient phase and adherence of subjects with the home-based program. Fifty subjects will be recruited from individuals who are 60 years of age or older who have been admitted to the Birmingham Veterans Affairs Medical Center (VAMC) for treatment of an acute medical condition. Subjects will be either unable to ambulate, require assistance for ambulation, or be unable to ambulate a functional distance (150 feet) at a functional velocity (30m/min). Subjects will be randomly assigned to a physical rehabilitation group (PR) or to a control group (CON). During hospitalization, subjects in the PR group daily will have one 45-minute morning rehabilitation session and one 30-minute evening rehabilitation session. Both sessions will include ambulation and transfer training. The longer morning session will also include resistance exercise. Subjects in the CON group will have medial care as it is currently provided. During the six months after discharge, subjects in the PR group will perform a home-based exercise program consisting of ambulation and resistance exercises. The program will be monitored and progressed by an exercise physiologist who will visit subjects weekly for the first month after discharge, every other week for the second and third months after discharge, and monthly in the fourth, fifth, and six months after discharge.

       "  'brief_summary': \"This study will evaluate changes in T cells-infection-fighting white blood cells of the immune system-in people given a drug called G-CSF before donating stem cells (immature bone marrow cells) for transplantation. Originally, bone marrow cells were obtained using a needle inserted into the hipbone of the donor. However, when it was discovered that immature bone marrow cells also circulate in the blood, scientists began to develop techniques to collect quantities of these cells from the blood instead of the bone. G-CSF is a blood cell growth factor that pushes stem cells from the bone marrow into the bloodstream. Stem cell donors are given this drug 5 to 6 days before donation to make more cells available in the circulating blood for collection.~Stem cell transplantation requires careful regulation of immune cell function to allow the donated stem cells to grow in the transplant recipient, to prevent the transplanted cells from damaging the recipient, and to allow the recipient's new immune system to develop normally so it can fight infections. Studies comparing the outcome of patients transplanted with bone marrow cells with those transplanted with stem cells suggest that the G-CSF given to stem cell donors affects the function of T cells in transplant recipients. This study will collect white cells containing T cells before and after G-CSF administration to determine the effects of the drug on both T cells and stem cells.~Healthy normal volunteers 18 years of age and older who meet the health criteria for donating blood may participate in this study. Pregnant and breastfeeding women are not eligible.~Participants will undergo the following procedures:~Blood sample collection (15 milliliters, or 3 teaspoons) to measure blood cell counts~Electrocardiogram to assess heart function~Apheresis to donate white blood cells. Participants will undergo two apheresis procedures-once before receiving G-CSF and a second time immediately after finishing the 5-day course of the drug. For this procedure, whole blood is removed using a needle placed in an arm vein. The blood is circulated through a cell separator machine, where the white cells are removed and collected in a plastic bag. The rest of the blood, including the red cells, platelets, and plasma, are returned to the donor through a needle in the other arm. The procedure takes 2 to 3 hours, during which time the donor lies quietly.\"},\n",

The responses to several dozen stimuli are averaged.~Nerve stimulation - The nerve to the muscle that flexes the leg is electrically stimulated near the knee through electrodes taped to the skin. The strength of the stimulus is adjusted to produce little or no muscle movement. The stimulation is repeated every few seconds for 45 minutes.~Transcranial magnetic stimulation - An insulated wire coil is placed on the subject's scalp. A brief electrical current passes through the coil, creating a magnetic pulse that travels through the scalp and skull and causes small electrical currents in the outer part of the brain. There may be twitching in the muscles of the arm or leg.

       "  'brief_summary': \"This study will determine whether magnesium replacement during apheresis can decrease side effects that donors commonly experience. Apheresis is a method of collecting large numbers of certain blood cells, such as white cells, stem cells, or platelets. In this procedure, whole blood is collected through a needle in an arm vein, similar to donating blood. The blood is separated into its components by centrifugation (spinning), the required cells are extracted, and the rest of the blood is returned to the body, either through the same needle or through another needle in the other arm.~When healthy people donate cells by apheresis, a blood thinner called citrate is added to prevent the blood from clotting in the apheresis machine. Citrate works by reducing calcium in the blood. When the blood is returned to the donor, citrate from the machine is also returned, lowering the donor's calcium levels. As a result, donors often feel tingling around the mouth, hands, and feet. Some of these symptoms can be prevented by giving calcium intravenously (through a vein) during the procedure. Even with the added calcium, however, some donors still have symptoms. Magnesium levels are also lowered by citrate, but it is not known if this causes symptoms. This study will examine whether the decrease in magnesium levels also contributes to the side effects of apheresis and whether magnesium replacement can reduce these symptoms.~Healthy apheresis donors 18 years of age or older who are enrolled in NIH protocols may participate in this study.~Donors will undergo the apheresis procedures required by the NIH protocol they are enrolled in. Throughout the procedure, they will receive an intravenous infusion of a salt solution that may or may not contain magnesium. Blood samples of 5 milliliters (1 teaspoon) each will be taken from the apheresis machine at the beginning and end of the procedure and at 30- to 60-minute intervals during the procedure. No more than 50 ml (3 tablespoons) will be taken during any single apheresis. The last sample will be drawn 60 minutes after completion of the apheresis. In addition, donors will:~Provide a urine sample at the beginning and end of each apheresis procedure.~Donate an additional urine sample and an additional 5 ml blood sample the morning after apheresis~Describe any symptoms experienced during apheresis to the apheresis nurse\"},\n",

Anticipating unpleasant stimuli increases or potentiates a simple reflex called the startle reflex. The so-called fear-potentiated startle reflex (FPS) effect may be blocked or reduced by anxiety-relieving drugs. Evidence suggests that the FPS can be mediated by two mechanisms that regulate the phasic- and sustained enhancement of startle. This study will elicit phasic and sustained FPS in participants by having them anticipate moderately painful stimuli that are administered predictably and unpredictably. The main goal of this study is to assess the affect of alprazolam on the phasic and sustained enhancement of startle.~This study comprises two pilot experiments and a main study. Participants in the study will be screened with a psychiatric history, physical examination, electrocardiogram (EKG), and blood and urine tests.

       "  'brief_summary': \"This study uses positron emission tomography (PET) to examine brain function and signaling involving phospholipids, and to see how signaling is related to blood flow. Much of the brain is composed of fatty molecules called phospholipids. These molecules are involved in the way brain cells signal each other to direct brain function. Brain disease may change phospholipids and disturb brain structure and signaling. Studies of brain phospholipid composition and metabolism may help clarify how the brain works in healthy people or stops working effectively in disease states.~Healthy volunteers between 18 and 45 years of age may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a medical history, physical examination, and blood and urine tests. Participants undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and PET scanning as follows:~MRI~MRI uses a magnetic field and radio waves to produce images of body tissues and organs. For this procedure, the subject lies on a table that is moved into a metal cylinder (the scanner) and wears earplugs to muffle loud knocking and thumping sounds that occur during the scanning process. Scanning time varies from 20 minutes to 3 hours, with most scans lasting between 45 and 90 minutes. Subjects may be asked to lie still for up to 30 minutes at a time.~PET~For the PET scan, a catheter (thin plastic tube) is inserted into an artery in the subject's wrist or elbow crease to collect blood samples during the procedure, and a second catheter is placed in a vein in the opposite arm to inject radioactive tracers. The subject lies on the scanner bed, wearing a special facemask and goggles. The mask helps hold the head still during the scans, and the goggles either block all light or administer bright flashing lights. Radioactive water is injected into the vein, followed by a 1-minute PET scan to measure brain blood flow. This is repeated three more times. Then, a radioactive fatty acid is injected into the vein, followed by a 1-hour PET scan to measure brain phospholipid metabolism. This is repeated once. The images of blood flow and phospholipid metabolism in the different regions of the brain under the conditions of darkness and during visual stimulation provide information on how and where the brain responds to visual stimulation. The entire procedure takes about 3 hours.\"},\n",

Homozygous sitosterolemia is an inherited disorder of sterol metabolism in which an excess of many plant sterols, including sitosterol, is absorbed and not enough excreted. (Sterols are substances used to form hormones, vitamins and membranes found in animal and plant lipids.). Patients can develop atherosclerosis with coronary heart disease as early as childhood, as well as other problems including arthritis, arthralgia, and tendon xanthomas (lipid deposits). Current sitosterolemia treatments may include a low sterol diet, medications, intestinal surgery, or a combination of these. Ezetimibe is a member of a new class of drugs called specific cholesterol absorption inhibitors that may lower cholesterol, sitosterol and other plant sterol blood levels.~Patients with homozygous sitosterolemia 10 years of age and older may be eligible for this study. Participants will have a medical history and physical examination and will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups. One group, which will include about 80 percent of all study participants, will take 10 mg of Ezetimibe a day, and the second group (20 percent of participants) will take a placebo (an inactive look-a-like pill).~Patients will have 7 clinic visits during the 12-week study, when some or all of the following procedures and tests will be done:~Measurement of vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, breathing rate and temperature)~Dietary maintenance - interview about how well that patient is adhering to the diet~Medication review - interview about other medications the patient is taking~Blood draw for tests~Urine sample for tests~Pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential~Electrocardiogram (ECG) to measure the electrical activity of the heart~Blood draw to determine sitosterol, other plant sterol levels, and lipid levels (cholesterol and other blood lipid concentrations)~Xanthoma measurement (with a ruler and X-ray of the foot)\"},\n",

       "  'brief_summary': 'This study will test the safety of an experimental vaccine against HIV and examine whether it induces an immune response to HIV. A vaccine is a substance given to try to create resistance or immunity to a disease or infection. The vaccine in this study is made from DNA (genetic material) of four HIV proteins called gag, pol, Nef, and Env. Injected into a human, the viral DNA instructs the body to make small amounts of some HIV proteins. This study will see if the body then creates an immune response to these proteins. Study participants cannot catch HIV or AIDS from the DNA vaccine or any proteins made from it.~Healthy normal volunteers between 18 and 60 years of age may be eligible for this study. Candidates will provide a medical history, including information on sexual behaviors and drug use. They will have a physical examination and blood and urine tests. Women will also have a pregnancy test. Women enrolled in the study must either be infertile (e.g., due to menopause or hysterectomy) or must agree either to abstain from heterosexual sex or to practice birth control for at least 21 days before beginning the study and throughout its duration.~Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either the experimental vaccine or a placebo (a control substance made up of an inactive salt solution) and will be divided into three groups, based on their entry into the study. Of the first seven people enrolled (Group 1), five will receive a 2-mg dose of vaccine and two will receive placebo. If the vaccine is safe at this dose, then in Group 2, five people will receive a 4-mg dose of vaccine and two will receive placebo. If this dose is safe, then in Group 3, thirty people will receive an 8-mg dose of vaccine and six will receive placebo.~All participants will receive three injections in an upper arm muscle-one injection a month for three months-with a needle-less device called a Biojector 2000® (Registered Trademark). At the time of each injection, participants will be observed for at least 1 hour after immunization. At home, they will record their temperature and any symptoms they may experience, including any effects at the injection site, for at least 2 days, or as long as the symptoms remain. If symptoms occur, participants will report them immediately to the clinic staff and, if necessary, come to the clinic for an examination.~Participants will have about 10 clinic visits during the study. Most visits will last about 2 hours; those on vaccination days will last about 4 hours. At each visit, participants will be checked for health changes or problems and will be asked about medications they are taking. Blood will be drawn for immune system testing. Additional laboratory tests may be requested between visits. Participants will be tested several times for HIV, will be questioned about their sexual behavior and drug use, and about social effects they may have experienced from their participation in the study.~Some of the blood drawn for this study will be used to test for HLA type-a genetic test of immune system markers. For research, HLA testing is sometimes used to try to identify factors associated with the progression of HIV disease or related conditions.'},\n",

       "  'brief_summary': 'This study will use transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to examine the relationship between cognitive processing and motor control by determining whether a part of the brain called the premotor cortex is essential to imagining movement. TMS, described below, is a method of brain stimulation that can temporarily inhibit brain functions of the area underlying the stimulator.~Healthy right-handed normal volunteers may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with a medical history, neurological examination, and test of finger dexterity.~Participants will perform a sequential finger tapping movement in response to a series of numbers (stimuli) displayed on a computer monitor. After 10 stimuli, they will be asked which finger they tapped last. They will then imagine the same finger tapping movement and will be asked which finger they tapped last in their imagination. During these exercises, participants will undergo transcranial magnetic stimulation. For this procedure, the subject is seated comfortably in a chair. A wire coil is placed on the scalp and a brief electrical current is passed through the coil, creating a magnetic pulse that passes into the brain. This generates a very small electrical current in the brain, which briefly disrupts the function of the brain cells in the stimulated area. The stimulation may cause twitching in arm or leg muscles. During the stimulation, the electrical activity of muscles is recorded with a computer or other recording device, using electrodes attached to the skin with tape.~Subjects will complete eight experimental blocks of testing. One block consists of 20 experimental trials, with each trial lasting about 10 seconds. Five pairs of TMS stimuli are given per trial, with pulses delivered in short bursts of one second each. After each block, subjects draw a mark on a line on paper, showing how much attention they are paying, how much fatigue they are experiencing, and how well they think they are executing the tasks. Each TMS session takes up to 3.5 hours.~Before the TMS session, participants will undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for use in determining proper placement of the TMS coil. MRI uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to obtain images of body organs and tissues. For this procedure, the subject lies still in a narrow metal cylinder (the scanner) for about 30 minutes during the scan.'},\n",

A vaccine is a substance given to try to create resistance or immunity to a disease or infection. The vaccine in this study is made from DNA (genetic material) of four HIV proteins called 'gag', 'pol', 'Nef', and 'Env'. Injected into a human, the viral DNA instructs the body to make small amounts of some HIV proteins. This study will see if the body then creates an immune response to these proteins. Study participants cannot catch HIV or AIDS from the DNA vaccine or any proteins made from it.~Healthy normal volunteers between 18 and 40 years of age may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with a medical history, physical examination and blood and urine tests. Women will also have a pregnancy test. Women enrolled in the study must either be infertile (e.g., due to menopause or hysterectomy) or must agree either to abstain from heterosexual sex or to practice birth control for at least 21 days before beginning the study and throughout its duration.~Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either the experimental vaccine or a placebo (a salt solution that does not contain any active substance) and will be divided into three groups, based on their entry into the study. Of the first seven people enrolled (Group 1), five will receive a 2-mg dose of vaccine and two will receive placebo. If the vaccine is safe at this dose, then in Group 2, five people will receive a 4-mg dose of vaccine and two will receive placebo. If this dose is safe, then in Group 3, thirty people will receive an 8-mg dose of vaccine and six will receive placebo.~All participants will receive three injections in an upper arm muscle-one injection a month for three months-with a needle-less device called a Biojector 2000® (Registered Trademark). At the time of each injection, participants will be observed for at least 1 hour after immunization. At home, they will record their temperature and any symptoms they may experience, including any effects at the injection site, for at least 7 days, or as long as the symptoms remain. If symptoms occur, participants will report them immediately to the clinic staff and, if necessary, come to the clinic for an examination.~Participants will have about 10 clinic visits during the study. Most visits will last about 2 hours; those on vaccination days will last about 4 hours. ...\"},\n",

       "  'brief_summary': \"This phase I study will evaluate the experimental drug Romidepsinin patients with advanced cancer. The study will: 1) determine how well patients tolerate Romidepsin; 2) measure blood levels of Romidepsin during treatment; 3) analyze the cellular and molecular effects of the drug; and 4) determine if Romidepsin can shrink tumors. Romidepsin has been shown to kill cancer cells growing in the laboratory and to shrink tumors in animals with various tumor types. In preliminary studies, several patients with a type of lymphoma and one patient with kidney cancer responded to treatment.~Patients 18 years of age and older with advanced cancer (excluding acute leukemia) may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a medical history and physical examination, x-rays and CT scans, and blood and urine tests. Patients with thyroid cancer may also have magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This test uses a magnetic field instead of x-rays to obtain images or body organs and tissues.~Participants receive three infusions of Romidepsin administered through an intravenous line over 4 hours on days 1, 3 and 5 of a 21-day treatment cycle. The intravenous line is a catheter (plastic tube) placed in a vein and may be a peripheral line, inserted in a vein in the arm, or a central line, in which the tube is placed under the skin of the chest or neck into a major vein. Patients are hospitalized for the first 6 days of the first cycle to monitor heart rate. Those who tolerate the treatment well may continue as an outpatient.~In addition to drug therapy, participants undergo the following procedures:~Blood tests: Small amounts of blood are drawn frequently during the first five days of treatment to measure Romidepsin levels and to see how the body uses and excretes the drug. A heparin lock (an indwelling device to keep the vein open) may be put in the vein to prevent the need for repeated needle sticks.~Biopsies (removal of a small sample of tumor tissue): Tumors that are accessible may be biopsied at the start of the study and at different times during treatment. Biopsies are done no more than three times per cycle, and no more than nine biopsies are done within a year. The samples are examined for the effects of Romidepsin on proteins that control the way cells divide and stay alive.~Apheresis: This procedure is done to collect white blood cells and cancer cells for research. Blood is collected through a needle in an arm vein and directed into a machine that separates it into its components by centrifugation (spinning). The white cells are removed and the red cells are returned to the patient through the same needle or through another needle in the other arm.~Scans and x-rays: Imaging studies are usually done before starting treatment. Some of them are repeated at every 2 cycles (6 weeks), and some at the end of the patient's participation in the study. The tests may include chest x-rays, plain x-rays of affected bones, CT scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, bone scans, and a MUGA scan (special X-ray of the heart) or echocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart) to test heart function before and during the study. MRI or positron emission tomography (PET) scans may also be done to detect tumors. PET scans use a small amount of a radioactive substance injected into a vein. The radioactivity is detected by a special camera during scanning to detect cancer cells.~Other tests include an electrocardiogram (recording of the electrical activity of the heart) before and after each dose of depsipeptide. Eye exams are done if there are vision changes or if the doctor recommends an eye test.\"},\n",

People who lack the enzyme G6PD or cytochrome B5 in their red blood cells may not participate. Absence of these enzymes can lead to episodes of sudden shortness of breath and cyanosis (blueness of the skin due to lack of sufficient oxygen). Participants will undergo the procedures described in study Parts A and B, as follows:~Part A - After numbing the skin, small tubes are placed in the artery and vein at the inside of the elbow of the dominant arm (right- or left-handed) and a small tube is placed in a vein of the other arm. The tubes are used for infusing saline (salt water) and for drawing blood samples. A pressure cuff is placed around the upper part of the dominant arm, and a rubber band device called a strain gauge is also placed around the arm to measure blood flow. When the cuff is inflated, blood flows into the arm, stretching the strain gauge at a rate proportional to the flow. Grip-strength of the dominant arm is measured with a dynamometer to determine maximum grip-strength. Then, several measurements of blood flow, nitrite, hemoglobin, and handgrip are made before and after administration of L-NMMA, a drug that blocks endothelial production of nitric oxide.~Part B - Part A testing is repeated, except that sodium nitrite dissolved in a saline solution is infused into the artery of the forearm for a few minutes before and during the hand-grip exercises. In addition, blood samples are drawn before and after each handgrip exercise to measure methemoglobin, a substance that, at excessive levels, can cause adverse side effects.'},\n",

The study consists of three experiments; participants will take part in either one or two of the experiments.~Healthy right-handed volunteers between 18 and 80 years of age with 12 or more years of education may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with a medical and educational history and a brief neurological examination. Participants in experiments 2 and 3 will also be screened with a verbal fluency test in which they will be asked to say as many words beginning with certain letters as they can in 1 minute.~Participants will undergo the following procedures for the experiment(s) in which they participate:~Experiment 1~While resting quietly, subjects receive 20 minutes of weak electrical current stimulation or sham stimulation with no current. For the stimulation, two gauze pads soaked with a conducting salt solution are placed on the head-one on the left side and one above the right eye. The current is passed between the pads and may cause an itching or tingling sensation under the electrodes. Before and after the stimulation, the participant's reaction time-tested by moving a finger as fast as possible at the sound of a tone-and mood are evaluated. Some participants also have an electroencephalogram, or EEG (brain wave recording) during the experiment. After the stimulation, participants take two brief tests of thinking speed, and the mood and reaction time tests are repeated.~Experiment 2~The participant sits in a chair with electrodes attached to the muscles that control movement in a finger on the right hand. Reaction time is tested as described in experiment 1. Then, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is used to test the activity of the brain's motor cortex (the part of the brain that controls movement). For TMS, an insulated wire coil is placed on the subject's scalp. A brief electrical current is passed through the coil, creating a magnetic pulse that travels through the scalp and skull and causes small electrical currents in the brain cortex. The stimulation may cause twitching of the right hand or arm or produce a mild snapping sensation on the scalp. During the stimulation, the electrical activity of muscles in the right hand is recorded on a computer. Following the TMS, DC stimulation is applied, as described in experiment 1. The stimulation begins at a low level and is followed by repeat TMS and DC stimulation at increasingly higher levels. This continues until there is a clear effect on the muscle response to the magnetic pulses, or until the stimulation becomes uncomfortable. At the end of the electrical stimulation, reaction time is tested again.~Experiment 3~This experiment uses the average DC level that produced a change in the size of the responses to magnetic stimulation in experiment 2. Thinking speed and reaction time are tested during the DC stimulation, and the mood test is given before and during the stimulation. This test does not use TMS or EEG recording.\"},\n",

The tubing then will be removed and they will be discharged with pain medicines (Tylenol, codeine and the study drug) and forms to record pain ratings. They will be given detailed instructions on how and when to take the medicines and how to record information in the pain diary.~Patients will return to the clinic 48 hours after surgery with the pain diary and pain relievers.

The purpose of this protocol is to determine (a) if movement observation results in encoding of a motor memory in the primary motor cortex and (b) if observation of motor training can enhance the effects of physical training in healthy volunteers. If so, this may become an important tool in rehabilitative treatment for patients who are unable or partially able to train. We will test our hypotheses by means of focal single pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in a group of healthy volunteers. Our outcome measure will be the change in TMS-evoked movement direction as a function of training strategy. So far we found that this is the case in healthy volunteers (see data in analysis of the study).

People remember only some of the events they experience every day, such as faces they perceive, words they read, speech they hear and interpret, and so forth. The events remembered are those that have been saved or formed in the brain. Part 1 of this study involves testing materials for Part 2, the TMS experiment. Part 2 uses TMS to examine what parts of the brain are involved in forming memories. Information gained from this study may be used in developing methods of enhancing memory in both healthy people and in patients with memory impairments.~Healthy right-handed volunteers between 18 and 35 years of age may be eligible for this study. Candidates may be screened with a medical interview and physical examination and a brief test of short- and long-term visual and verbal memory. Eligible volunteers may participate in Part 1 or Part 2 of the study, as follows:~Part 1 - Preparation of Words and Picture Materials~Participants look at several words or shapes that appear in random order on a computer screen and try to remember them as well as possible for a memory test that will be given 20 minutes later. Each image appears on the screen for 3/4 of a second, with 1-1/4-second intervals between them. For the test, words and shapes are again shown on the computer screen at the same timing and intervals. When the items appear, the subject presses one of three buttons as quickly as possible, determining if he or she has recognized the items with a high or low level of confidence. The entire procedure lasts up to 1 hour, with breaks in between. The purpose of this experiment is to find appropriate words and pictures to use as stimuli in the TMS study described below.~Part 2 - TMS Experiment~For TMS, the subject sits in a comfortable chair. An insulated wire coil is placed on the scalp, and brief electrical currents are passed through the coil, creating magnetic pulses that stimulate the brain. The pulses may cause a pulling sensation on the skin under the coil and twitching in muscles of the arm or leg. Electrodes are taped to the skin over some muscles of the hands to record the electrical activity of the muscles. Pulses are delivered in trains or short bursts of impulses, each lasting half a second. Participants receive 90 trains for a total of 900 pulses. TMS is applied during the first part of the memory study, when the words and shapes are first presented on the computer screen, but not during the second presentation for memory testing. The entire procedure takes up to 2 hours, with breaks in between.~Before the TMS session, participants undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to determine where to place the coil for TMS. For MRI, the subject lies still for up to 30 minutes at a time on a table that slides into the scanner, a narrow metal cylinder surrounded by a strong magnetic field. Earplugs are worn to muffle loud knocking sounds that occur while the scanner takes pictures. Subjects can communicate with the MRI staff at all times and can ask to stop the procedure at any time.'},\n",

Reflexes will be measured with nerve conduction studies and somatosensory evoked potential (SSEP) recordings before and after training. Nerve conduction studies measure the speed with which nerves conduct electrical impulses and the strength of the connection between the nerve and the muscle. For these studies, a probe is placed on the skin over the calf muscles and the knee to deliver a small electrical stimulus, and wires are taped to the skin to record the impulses. SSEP recordings, which measure of the excitability of the brain to sensory stimuli, are collected from electrodes placed on the scalp.~After the training period, multiple train stimulation (MTS) is applied for 10 minutes. For MTS, weak electrical currents are delivered for 10 seconds every 10 seconds. These stimuli produce a buzzing sensation without pain, discomfort, or muscle twitching. The MTS is followed by another 4 minutes of cycling.~Participants also undergo transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). For this procedure, an insulated wire coil is held over the scalp. A brief electrical current is passed through the coil, creating a magnetic pulse that travels through the scalp and skull and causes small electrical currents in the brain cortex (outer part of the brain). The stimulation may cause twitching in the muscles of the face, arm, or leg. The electrical activity of the muscles is recorded with a computer or other recording device, using electrodes attached to the skin with tape.'},\n",

Except for the increase in magnetic field, all other aspects of imaging are the same as those at lower magnetic fields. This study will use techniques in conjunction with the higher magnetic field that may improve diagnostic imaging. The MRI will monitor the brain at high resolution to see structural features, to measure brain chemicals, and to determine how much and how fast blood flows into brain regions in response to simple tasks.~Healthy normal volunteers 18 years of age and older may participate in this study. Candidates will be screened with a medical history, neurological examination, and questionnaire.~Participants will have a standard 1.5 or 3 Tesla MRI before the 7 Tesla scan, adding about 5 minutes to the procedure. The procedure for both scans is the same. The subject lies on a table that is moved into the scanner. Because the machine makes loud sounds during the imaging, earplugs are provided to help reduce the noise. An insulated wire coil may be placed around the subject's head to obtain better images. Scanning time varies from 20 minutes to 3 hours, with most examinations lasting between 45 and 90 minutes. During the scan, the subject may be asked to perform simple tasks, such as listening to tones, tapping fingers, moving a hand, watching a movie on a screen, or smelling pleasant odors. More complex tasks may require thinking about tones or pictures and responding to them by pressing buttons. Following the test, subjects will complete a brief questionnaire about comfort level and any unusual sensations they may have experienced during the test.~Participants who undergo repeated MRIs for the evaluation of new techniques will have a standard 1.5 or 3 Tesla MRI brain study once a year while participating in the research protocol. A radiologist at NIH will read the MRIs, and if any abnormalities are discovered, the individual will be referred to his or her private physician or to a consult service at NIH.~...\"},\n",

When patients undergo CT scanning to help guide the physician during a tissue biopsy, they are usually asked to hold their breath while the scan is taken of certain parts of the body. When the first scan is completed, the patients are allowed to breathe, and are then asked to hold their breath again while the needle is advanced towards the tissue to be biopsied. Since body organs and tissues move with breathing, this study will try to stop the patient's breathing at the same place in the breathing cycle to ensure that the biopsy target stays still and in the same place. This study will see if the flexible belt, used with a computer screen that charts the patient's breathing, will improve the patient's ability to stop breathing at the same place in the breathing cycle before and during the biopsy.~Patients 18 years of age and older who have a lesion requiring a needle biopsy in the chest or abdominal area may be eligible for this study. The biopsy procedure must require CT scan guidance.~Participants will undergo the following procedures:~Breathing exercise: A flexible, loose-fitting belt is placed around the patient's abdomen and the patient is asked to stop breathing in the following ways: 1) take a deep breath in and hold; 2) breathe deeply out and hold; and 3) breathe regularly and hold.~Needle biopsy: The patient is positioned in a CT scanner and is asked to hold his or her breath while an initial scan is taken. Then the patient is taken out of the scanner and the place the needle entry site for the biopsy is marked on the skin. A local anesthetic is applied to the site and the patient is asked to hold his or her breath the same way as before. During this breath hold, the patient may or may not be shown a computer screen displaying a graph of the patient's breathing and the point in the cycle of the previous breath hold. The biopsy is then performed with CT guidance. While the CT pictures are being taken, the patient is again asked to breathe and hold his or her breath as before. When the biopsy is completed, the belt device is removed.\"},\n",

       "  'brief_summary': 'This study will examine loss of balance in the elderly. Falls due to balance problems are a major health issue in older people, often resulting in bone fractures and other bodily injuries, and functional decline. In addition, the fear of falling leads some elderly people to restrict their movements and social activities, causing depressed moods and decreased enjoyment of life. Risk factors for falling in the elderly include some standing positions in which older people usually experience balance problems, such as leaning forward or backward. This study will examine these unstable positions and the brain mechanisms associated with loss of balance in the elderly.~Normal volunteers between 20 and 90 years of age may be eligible for this study. Candidates must be in good health, with no difficulties in performing activities of daily living, and must be able to walk for at least 400 meters (1/4 mile). They will be screened with a medical history, physical examination, and blood tests.~Participants will undergo the following three experiments:~Movement task: The subject stands on a platform with markers placed at different parts of the body to record body movements. A cap with electrodes (metal disks) is placed on the head for electrocardiographic (EEG) recording of the electrical activity of the brain (brain waves) during the experiment. The positions of the feet on the platform are measured. While standing on the platform, the subject leans forward and backward as far as possible without losing balance. (Subjects are secured in a safety harness to prevent actual falls.) The task is repeated 5 times. The experiment lasts up to 2 hours.~Postural response task: This study is identical to the first, except that the subject does not voluntarily lean forward and backward, but is pushed with a device to cause forward and backward movements. The experiment lasts 1 to 2 hours.~Perceptual task: The subject sits in front of a computer screen and watches the postural movements of a human body model in forward and backward directions. When the subject recognizes an unstable position in the movements, he or she presses a computer mouse. An EEG records brain activity during the task, which lasts up to 2 hours.'},\n",

       "  'brief_summary': 'This study will evaluate the ease and reliability of Raman scattering spectroscopy, a new technique to measure the amount of the pigment lutein in the retina, the light-sensitive tissue lining the back of the eye. The highest concentrations of lutein are in the center of the retina, called the macula, which is the area most important for fine, detailed vision. The functions of lutein are not fully known. Besides absorbing blue light, it may help protect against abnormal changes in the retina, such as age-related macular degeneration. Until recently, lutein was measured using long, cumbersome, and difficult tests. This study will evaluate a new instrument that provides faster measurements. It will be tested under different conditions, such as wearing or not wearing glasses or contact lenses, or dilating or not dilating the pupil of the eye.~Healthy normal volunteers between 20 and 65 years of age may be eligible for this study, which involves two visits to the NIH Clinical Center, as follows:~Visit 1 - Screening~Medical history and physical examination, including measurement of vital signs (blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and breathing rate), and examination of the head and neck, heart and lungs, and arms and legs.~Eye examination, including eye chart test, eye pressure measurement, examination of pupils and eye movements, and examination of the retina (back part of the eye) using a strong light and magnifying lens after dilation of the pupils.~Raman scattering spectroscopy to measure lutein. For this test, the subject looks with one eye at a brief, bright flash of bluish light (similar to a flashbulb light) from a laser. This is repeated several times. Subjects who wear glasses or contact lenses for distance vision will be tested without them and then again with a lens in front of the eye. Subjects who do not wear glasses or contact lenses will be tested before and after dilation of the pupil.~Contrast sensitivity to assess ability to identify an object from the background and to see everyday objects. The subject looks at and identifies a variety of objects of different shapes and sizes.~Color vision to determine the ability to identify different shades of color. The subject arranges a line of colorful discs, similar to checkers, in order of similar shades.~Visit 2 - Repeat Spectroscopy~Subjects return 1 week after the screening visit for a repeat Raman scattering spectroscopy to evaluate the precision of the measurements.'},\n",

The relationship between temperament and risk or resilience may reflect the influences of brain activity on behavior at different stages of childhood development. Behavioral inhibition and mood or anxiety disorders have been linked to disturbances in the circuitry of several areas in the brain. However, the involvement of this circuitry in temperament remains unclear. This study will use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine the function of different parts of the brain in children who have previously undergone temperament studies and have had their temperaments classified.~Two sets of studies will be performed in the current protocol. A small set of pilot studies will be performed in infants, by staff at the University of Maryland. In terms of the studies among infants, these subjects will initially be contacted by staff at Maryland and then will be seen at the NIH for up to three visits lasting between 4- to 5- hours during the first year of life. These subjects also will undergo visits at the University of Maryland throughout the first year of life.~This study will comprise up to four clinic visits. At Visit 1, children and their parents will meet with study staff individually and together for psychiatric interviews. Children will undergo a physical examination, medical history, a urine drug test, and practice in an fMRI simulator.

Choline is an essential nutrient found in many foods, including eggs and milk. In addition to dietary sources, choline can be made in the liver. Choline is important in making membranes or wrappers for all the cells in the body and for making chemicals that allow nerve cells to work properly. In a previous study we found that the dietary requirement for choline varies greatly from person to person. This was caused, in part, by how much estrogen a person has and their genetic makeup. We are conducting this study to explore how estrogen levels and specific differences in genes influence choline requirements so that we can refine the dietary recommendations for this nutrient.'},\n",

Younger women will have a urine pregnancy test and older women will have a test to confirm post-menopausal status.~Participants will have two study sessions at the NIH Clinical Center outpatient clinic. They come to the clinic by taxi and, upon arrival, take a breathalyzer test for any measurable alcohol levels. They are then given breakfast, after which two catheters (plastic tubes) are placed, one in a vein in each arm. One tube is used to collect blood samples for measuring hormone levels; the other is for infusing alcohol. The infusion is adjusted so that the breath alcohol level is held constant for about 3 hours at a moderate level. Baseline measurements are taken before the infusion begins. During and after the infusion, the participants fill out questionnaires about their moods and feelings. Breath alcohol level and heart rate measurements are monitored frequently. After the test, participants remain in the clinic until their breath alcohol level drops below 0.02 g/L (generally 2 to 3 hours after the infusion stops). They are given lunch and then sent home in a taxi.~Participants also undergo a dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan to determine lean body mass and a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the abdomen to determine liver size. For the DEXA scan, the subject lies still on a table for about 30 minutes while the whole body is scanned using a small amount of radiation.

       "  'brief_summary': \"This study will examine the central regions and brain activation patterns associated with simple vocal behaviors under conditions of normal auditory feedback-when people hear themselves speak. Such feedback plays a major role in learning and maintaining human voice control. But voice control can be harmed by neurological injury or disease, reducing the ability of a person to orally communicate. Research has shown that auditory feedback is continuously monitored, brought about by both automatic and voluntary corrections in the amplitude (loudness) and frequency of (pitch) of the human voice. This study aims to determine which areas of the brain have activity dependent on the level of blood oxygen. It will provide new knowledge about basic vocal motor control and provide a basis for investigations into the integration of hearing and speaking in human vocal expression throughout life.~Participants 18 to 45 years of age with normal hearing and voice function and with a steady heart rate may be eligible for this study.~Participants will be evaluated by a speech-language specialist, regarding a history of voice health and measures of voice function. They will be tested on their ability to vary voice amplitude and frequency and tested on their hearing. Also, they will undergo an electrocardiogram to determine their heart rate.~For the study, participants will undergo an MRI scan. During the MRI scan, patients will lie still on a table that can slide in and out of a metal cylinder surrounded by a strong magnetic field. Scanning time varies from 20 minutes to 3 hours, with most scans between 45 and 90 minutes. Patients may be asked to lie still for up to 90 minutes at a time. As the scanner takes pictures, there will be loud knocking noises, and patients will wear headphones to muffle the sound. The headphones will also enable patients to hear their voice. The patient's head will be positioned with a coil of 25 to 30 cm diameter and supported by a headrest. A microphone will be placed about 2 cm from the patient's mouth for communication and collection of data. Also, an angled mirror will be attached to the head coil, so that the patient can look outside of the scanner. By way of a projection screen, the patient will receive a visual cue to vocalize, or use his or her voice.~Patients will be asked to repeatedly do some of the following vocalization tasks: (1) rest, (2) hum or sigh without voicing (exhale), (3) hum or sigh audibly, (4) hum audibly while increasing or decreasing voice frequency, and (5) hum audibly while increasing or decreasing voice amplitude. During the scan, patients will be able to communicate with the MRI staff at all times and may ask to be moved out of the machine at any time. Some scans may be done in a 3 Tesla scanner. It is the latest advance in MRI, with a stronger magnetic field than in the more common 1.5 Tesla scanner. Functional MRI is done while a person is performing tasks, such as moving a limb or speaking. The fMRI scan will take about 1 hour.\"},\n",

       "  'brief_summary': \"This study will evaluate the impact of the HIV protease inhibitor ritonavir on the pharmacokinetics-that is, the interaction of the medication and the body-of prednisolone after prednisone is given to healthy volunteers. Prednisone, an agent known as a corticosteroid, or steroid hormone, is converted by the body into prednisolone. Ritonavir is an HIV medication that fights the virus by blocking its ability to reproduce. Sometimes it increases the blood levels of other drugs given at the same time, and it is possible that ritonavir increases the blood levels of prednisolone and those of other medications. Results from the study will provide information on whether prednisone and ritonavir interact in a potentially harmful way. The MDR1 genotype, that is, part of a person's genetic constitution, may influence how prednisolone behaves.~Patients 18 to 50 years of age who are in good health, who not have HIV, and who do not smoke may be eligible for this study. There will be 10 participants and another 5 later who will be control subjects. Those in the control group will take only prednisone, not ritonavir.~Participants will undergo the following tests and procedures:~Medical history and physical examination.~Collection of blood and urine to assess general health.~Collection of blood to examine markers on white blood cells and to determine the kind of MDR1 gene was inherited.~HIV test.~The screening visit will take about 3 to 4 hours, and the study will take about 28 to 49 days. For 3 study days, participants will remain in the clinic for 12 hours, On Study Day 1, patients will be asked to not eat or drink anything besides water before coming to the clinic. Blood samples will be collected to measure prednisolone concentration as well as osteocalcin, a blood protein involved in bone formation. Blood tests will also allow a look at the surfaces of some white blood cells. Patients will receive a breakfast along with 20 mg of prednisone. Urine samples will be collected also. Then patients will be dismissed and asked to collect urine samples and return them on the following morning, Study Day 2. At that time there will additional blood collection. Patients will begin taking ritonavir between 7 and 28 days after the first dose of prednisone, at a dose of 200 mg (two 100 mg capsules) twice daily with food, to continue for 15 days. On the 4th and 14th days of their taking ritonavir, patients will be asked to visit the clinic in the morning for a blood to measure ritonavir in the blood and to take a single 20-mg dose of prednisone along with the ritonavir. Both medications will be taken with breakfast. Blood and urine levels of prednisolone will also be measured. On the 15th day of ritonavir dosing, there will be another blood collection for routine lab tests, as well as studies on blood cells and osteocalcin.\"},\n",

       "  'brief_summary': \"This study will examine the effects of repeated apheresis procedures on bone density and calcium balance. Apheresis is a procedure for collecting large numbers of a specific blood component, such as white cells (leukapheresis) or platelets (plateletpheresis). For the procedure, whole blood is collected through a needle in an arm vein and is directed through a machine that separates it into its components by spinning. The desired cells are removed and the rest of the blood is returned to the donor, either through the same needle or through a needle in the other arm. A blood thinning medicine called citrate is added to the cell-separating machine. Citrate reduces the ionized calcium levels in the blood, which prevents the blood from clotting. When the blood is returned to the donor, the donor also receives the citrate. This lowers the donor's ionized calcium levels which may irritate nerve and muscle cells, causing tingling around the mouth, hands, and feet during the procedure. The reduced ionized calcium levels result in increased parathyroid hormone levels in the donor, can effect bone calcium stores. In addition, some of the citrate that is returned to the donor is excreted in the urine along with calcium, which causes further loss of calcium from the body. It is not known if the calcium loss during apheresis in people who undergo this procedure repeatedly has any long-term effects on body calcium balance and bone calcium stores. This study will measure bone density and calcium balance in long-term platelet and white cell donors and compare the findings with those of whole blood donors, who do not receive citrate.~Healthy people between 18 and 80 years of age who weigh between 110 and 300 pounds, do not have a metal prosthesis, and are not pregnant may be eligible for this study.

The scan may be repeated after 2 years.~Some apheresis donors may be asked to have a second procedure in which they take calcium according to standard guidelines for plateletpheresis and leukapheresis. During the second procedure, platelet donors will take oral calcium tablets before starting plateletpheresis. White cell donors will receive calcium intravenously (through a vein) during the second leukapheresis. For this second procedure, the donors provide additional blood and urine samples as described above.\"},\n",

       "  'brief_summary': 'This study is divided into two parts; each designed to answer a separate but related question:~Which brain regions are activated in humans by the rewarding properties of ethanol administration?~Is it possible to demonstrate a conditioned response to a stimulus paired with rising blood alcohol concentrations (BAC) in humans and can this response be observed in the brain using functional magnetic resonance images (fMRI) techniques?~Part 1. In order to determine which brain regions are activated by the rewarding properties of ethanol administration, we propose to use Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) fMRI techniques to test the hypothesis that during the time of rising and peak BAC, mesolimbic, mesocortical, and nigrostriatal dopamine (DA) terminal areas of the brain will show significant increases in cerebral blood flow. Healthy, non-alcoholic subjects will be given intravenous (IV) ethanol or placebo infusions on separate days. The infusions will have three phases. On each day, during the first phase a saline infusion will be used to measure basal brain blood flow. The second phase will be an ethanol infusion delivered at rates calculated to produce a BAC of 0.08 plus or minus 0.005 g/dl at 10 minutes. The rate of the infusion for the next 10 minutes (third phase) will be calculated to maintain BAC at the target level of 0.08 plus or minus 0.005 g/dl for the duration of the infusion. On the placebo day, subjects will receive a saline infusion at the same set of rates for phases two and three as used during their ethanol infusion. Continuous multi-slice fMRI data will be collected during each infusion.~Part 2. In order to investigate conditioned response to ethanol, three groups of healthy, non-alcoholic subjects will be given a series of IV infusions on separate days. The experimental group will receive ethanol infusion paired with a conditioned stimulus (CS) which will be presented while the BAC is rising. One control group (I) of healthy, non-alcoholic subjects will also be given a series of intravenous ethanol infusions on separate days, but these infusions will not be paired with a CS. The other control group (II) will be given only saline infusions during the CS presentation. After three training sessions, all three groups will undergo an fMRI scan during which the CS will be paired with saline infusion. This will allow the response to the CS alone to be observed. After 10 minutes of CS presentation, the ethanol infusion will begin and continue for another 15 minutes. Conditioned response (CR) will be demonstrated if the experimental group shows greater increase in BOLD signal than the control groups in motivation areas such as mesolimbic, mesocortical, and nigrostriatal dopamine (DA) terminal areas of the brain in response to the CS while they receive the saline infusion. Control group II will also undergo an fMRI scan and will be given saline infusion followed by ethanol infusion during their last 15 minutes in the scanner to control for the non-specific effects of repeated infusions & scans on BOLD response to ethanol. If we are able to produce a CR in brain regions associated with motivation, it may be possible to use this CR as an experimental model for human alcohol craving.'},\n",

       "  'brief_summary': \"This study will examine the use of positron emission tomography (PET) for measuring docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) absorption from the blood into the brain. DHA is a type of fatty acid found in fish and other seafood. It is involved in brain cell activity that underlies the ability to think, move, and respond to the outside world. When the amount of DHA in the brain is low, the brain may not work the same as if there were a normal amount of DHA. If PET can be used successfully to evaluate brain DHA metabolism, this method might be useful for future studies of alcoholism, since brain DHA levels are influenced by alcohol consumption.~Healthy normal volunteers between 18 and 65 years of age may be eligible for this study. Because study participants must stop taking any medications, including herbal preparations, individuals who require regular medication are excluded from this protocol. Participants will undergo the following tests and procedures:~Psychological questionnaires concerning thoughts and behaviors.~Nutritional status analysis: A dietitian will assess the subject's nutritional status through questionnaires and measurement of body fat. Body fat is measured using bioelectrical impedance analysis. This analysis uses a low, safe electric current to measure body composition, giving a reading of the percentage of fat in the body.~Fat biopsy to measure the composition of fat tissue: An area on the upper half of the buttock will be numbed and a needle will be inserted to aspirate a sample of fat tissue for analysis.~Blood drawing: Blood samples will be collected at the time of the fat biopsy and the PET scan (see below) to measure DHA and indicators that may influence DHA.~Diet: 3 days before the fat biopsy and at least 3 days before the PET scan, subjects will consume a diet low in DHA and other omega-3 fats. This no seafood diet prohibits eating fish, shellfish, seaweed, seafood, health food products or supplemental vitamins, and foods containing canola or flaxseed oil. Caffeine-containing beverages are limited to one per day for 3 days before the study. Alcoholic beverages are prohibited for 2 weeks before the study. For 24 hours before the PET scan, subjects eat only standard meals that will be provided to them.~Magnetic resonance imaging: A brain MRI scan will be done to fit the PET scan images onto a picture of the whole brain. During the scan, the subject lies on a table inside a narrow metal cylinder containing a strong magnetic field.~PET scan: Before the PET scan, catheters (small plastic tubes) are inserted into an arm vein and into a wrist artery. The venous catheter is used for injecting a radioactive substance that will be detected by the scanner, and the arterial catheter is used for collecting blood samples during the scan. For the scan, the subject lies on a bed that slides into the doughnut-shaped scanner. A mask is placed to keep the head still. A transmission scan is done to see how much radiation the skull absorbs. Radioactive water (15O-water) is then injected into the blood, and the brain is scanned for about 10 minutes to measure brain blood flow. Then, radioactive DHA (11C-DHA) is injected, followed by about 1-1/2 hours of scanning to measure DHA absorption into the brain.\"},\n",

       "  'brief_summary': 'Peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPC) have become the preferred source of hematopoetic stem cells for allogeneic transplantation because of technical ease of collection and shorter time required for engraftment. Traditionally, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) has been used to procure the peripheral blood stem cell graft. Although regimens using G-CSF usually succeed in collecting adequate numbers of PBPC from healthy donors, 5%-10% will mobilize stem cells poorly and may require multiple large volume apheresis or bone marrow harvesting. Although G-CSF is generally well tolerated in healthy donors, it may be associated with bone pain, headache, myalgia and rarely life threatening side effects like stroke, myocardial infarction and splenic rupture.~AMD3100, is a bicyclam compound that inhibits the binding of stromal cell derived factor-1 (SDF-1) to its cognate receptor CXC- chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4). CXCR4 is present on cluster of differentiation 34 (CD34)+ hematopoetic progenitor cells and its interaction with stromal cell derived factor 1 (SDF-1) plays a pivotal role in the homing of CD34+ cells in the bone marrow. Inhibition of the CXCR4-SDF1 axis by AMD3100 releases CD34+ cells into the circulation, which can then be collected easily by apheresis.~Recently, a published report demonstrated that large numbers of CD34+ cells were rapidly mobilized in healthy volunteers following a single subcutaneous injection of AMD3100. Remarkably, the number of CD34+ cells collected by apheresis following a single injection of AMD3100 was comparable to the number of CD34+ cells collected from historical controls receiving 5 days of G-CSF prior to stem cell mobilization.~In this study we will collect PBPCs following a single subcutaneous injection of AMD3100 from healthy donors who have previously had PBPC collected using standard G-CSF mobilization. The AMD3100 mobilized cells, G-CSF mobilized cells, and circulating cells prior to both AMD3100 and G-CSF mobilization will be analyzed in terms of cellular content and function of lymphocytes, natural killer (NK) cells, and antigen presenting cells. AMD3100 mobilized PBPC will be collected for the purpose of research studies and will not be used for therapeutic purposes.'},\n",

Medications such as protease inhibitors can dramatically change the course of HIV infection in many patients; however, among their side effects is development of abnormal lipid levels resulting in high cholesterol and insulin resistance. These side effects may damage the lining of the arteries that supply blood to the heart, leading to premature coronary artery disease. The study will determine whether lopinavir/ritonavir directly affects endothelial function and whether it alters cholesterol levels, glucose tolerance, and markers of inflammation in people who take the drug for 4 weeks.~Healthy normal volunteers between 18 and 40 years of age may be eligible for this study. Candidates must be HIV-negative and have no history of heart disease, hypertension, or diabetes mellitus. They must not have smoked for at least 6 weeks before entering the study. Volunteers will be screened with a medical history, physical examination, blood tests (including a pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential), and electrocardiogram. In addition, candidates will have an oral glucose tolerance test (see description below).~Participants will undergo the following procedures:~Lopinavir/ritonavir: 4 weeks (3 capsules twice a day) beginning study day 1~Flow-mediated vasodilatation test (study days 0 and 29) - An ultrasound device for measuring the size of the brachial artery (artery in the upper arm) is placed just above the elbow. The size of the artery is measured before and 5 minutes after blood flow to the arm is stopped for 5 minutes, using a blood pressure cuff. The artery is also measured before and after taking nitroglycerin, a medicine that dilates blood vessels. These measurements tell how well the drug treatment works on the cells lining the brachial artery, which is an indicator of coronary artery function. This test takes about 1.5 hours.~Forearm blood-flow test (study days 1 and 30): Small tubes are inserted into an artery and vein in the forearm at the inside of the elbow. Blood pressure cuffs are placed around the upper arm and wrist, and a strain gauge (a rubber band-like device) is placed around the forearm. When the blood pressure cuffs are inflated, blood flows into the forearm, stretching the strain gauge at a rate proportional to the blood flow. When the devices are in place, a salt water solution is injected in the small tube in the artery. After 20 minutes, small doses of the following drugs are given through the catheter at various intervals: 1) L-NMMA (blocks production of nitric oxide, a substance produced by the blood vessels that causes them to dilate); 2) sodium nitroprusside (dilates blood vessels, increasing blood flow); 3) acetylcholine (lowers blood pressure); and 4) acetylcholine plus L-NMMA. The effect of the different drugs on blood flow in the forearm is measured. The study takes about 2 hours to complete.~Blood tests (screening and study days 1,15, 30, and 44)~Electrocardiogram (at screening and on study day 30)~Oral glucose tolerance test (at screening and on study day 30) - A blood sample is collected.

The electrical activity corresponding to the twitches is recorded by attaching electrodes (small metal disks) to the skin over the hand muscles.~Transcranial magnetic stimulation~For this test, an insulated wire coil is held over the scalp. A brief electrical current passes through the coil, creating a magnetic pulse that electrically stimulates the brain. The subject hears a click and may feel a pulling sensation on the scalp under the coil. The stimulation may also cause twitching in the muscles of the face, arm, or leg.

Patients will be screened for eligibility with a medical history, physical examination, and blood tests.~Participants will undergo the following tests and procedures:~Central line placement: A large intravenous catheter (plastic tube, or IV line) is placed in a vein in the chest or neck under local anesthesia before the transplant surgery. The line remains in place for some time during the hospitalization to administer Thymoglobulin, antibiotics, and blood, if needed. The line is also used to collect blood samples.~Leukapheresis: This procedure for collecting white blood cells is done before the transplant. The cells are studied to evaluate the patient's immune system. Whole blood is withdrawn through a catheter in an arm vein or through the central line and directed into a machine that separates the blood components by spinning. The white cells are removed and the red cells and plasma are returned to the body.~Kidney transplant: Patients undergo kidney transplant surgery under general anesthesia.~Immunosuppressive therapy: Patients receive thymoglobulin by vein for 4 days starting 1 day before the transplant. They also take Tylenol, Benadryl and a steroid (methylprednisolone) to help reduce the side effects of the Thymoglobulin. After the transplant, patients receive Tacrolimus and Sirolimus by mouth once a day for 6 months and then either Tacrolimus or Sirolimus alone indefinitely. In addition, they take medicines to help prevent viral and fungal infections for 6 months because the immunosuppressive therapy leaves them vulnerable to infection.~Follow-up visits: After hospital discharge, patients return to the Clinical Center twice a week for 4 weeks, then every 6 months for 1 year, and then yearly for another 4 years. At each visit, the patient's vital signs are checked and blood and urine samples are collected. Periodically, patients are also questioned about how they feel and how the transplant has affected their quality of life. Kidney biopsies (removal of a small amount of kidney tissue through a thin needle) are done when the patient begins single-drug immunosuppression (generally 6 months after transplantation) and 1 year after that.

       "  'brief_summary': 'This study will evaluate how well different medications work to relieve pain following third molar (wisdom tooth) extraction. Scientists believe that hormone-like substances called prostanoids contribute to pain following oral surgery. Prostanoids are produced by cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes. This study will examine how different medicines inhibit the COX enzymes and reduce the amount of prostanoids, and thus the amount of inflammation and pain. The study will also look at genetic factors involved in the production of prostanoids and the response to pain medication. (Only the bottom two wisdom teeth are extracted for this study. Patients whose top wisdom teeth also need to be removed will have those teeth extracted, also free of charge, at least 2 weeks after the first surgery.)~Healthy normal volunteers between 16 and 35 years of age who are in general good health and who require third molar extraction may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a medical history and oral examination, including dental x-rays as needed to confirm the need for third molar removal.~On the morning of surgery, patients have blood drawn to obtain DNA for genetic study. Women of childbearing age have a urine pregnancy test. One hour before surgery, patients receive a dose of rofecoxib (Vioxx® (Registered Trademark)), acetaminophen (Tylenol® (Registered Trademark)), or placebo (a pill with no active ingredient). A half-hour before surgery, they receive either a standard painkiller called keterolac (Toradol® (Registered Trademark))) or placebo through an arm vein. All patients also receive the sedative midazolam (Versed® (Registered Trademark)), also through an arm vein, to induce drowsiness and a local anesthetic (lidocaine) to numb the mouth. After the mouth is numbed, but before the wisdom teeth are extracted, a biopsy (removal of a small piece of tissue) is conducted in the area of the cheek next to the wisdom tooth.~After the surgery, a small piece of tubing is placed into both extraction sites. Every 20 minutes for the next 3 hours, inflammatory fluid is collected from the tubing to measure chemicals that are believed to cause pain and swelling. Patients complete questionnaires every 20 minutes to rate their pain. Those who still have pain an hour after surgery may request and receive a rescue drug called tramadol (Ultram® (Registered Trademark)) for pain relief. Patients remain in the clinic from 3 to 6 hours to monitor the effects of the study drugs as the anesthetic wears off.~After surgery a second biopsy is done to measure any changes in the chemicals being produced in response to the surgery. For this biopsy, patients are assigned to one of two groups - one group has the second biopsy within 3 hours of surgery, before taking the rescue drug, and the other group returns to the clinic the next morning for a biopsy 24 hours after surgery. Patients in the second group leave the clinic after surgery with two pain medications (tramadol and the study drug) and forms to record pain ratings at home. They are permitted to take only the pain medications provided and only at certain times.~At the end of their participation in the study, all patients are given the pain medication flurbiprofen (Ocufen® (Registered Trademark)) to take at home.'},\n",

During the scan, the subject lies on a table in a narrow cylinder containing a magnetic field.

Participants will undergo the following tests and procedures in two clinic visits:~Visit 1 - Sensitivity Testing~Participants are tested for sensitivity to warm and hot temperatures. A probe is applied to the skin (usually the forearm) and heated to temperatures ranging from room temperature to that of a hot cup of coffee. Participants rate the temperature using a scale ranging from no pain to the worst pain imaginable and rate the unpleasantness of the heat using a similar scale. The probe is applied up to 30 times, using random heat intensities. Participants are also asked compare the heat intensity to varying levels of sounds and to rate the magnitude of different sensations they have experienced in the past, such as the brightness of the sun and the loudness of a jet plane. A blood sample of about 2 ounces is also collected at this visit for DNA analysis to look for genes related to pain.~Visit 2 - Oral Surgery~Under local anesthetic, participants undergo extraction of their lower right wisdom tooth. After surgery, the patient is moved to the MRI scanner for brain imaging over 1-2 hours while the local anesthetic wears off. Patients may request a postoperative pain drug (Toradol) during the procedure, if needed. When the scan is complete, patients are dismissed from the clinic with additional pain medication (flurbiprofen) to use at home as directed.'},\n",

The protein causes the cells to pump out, or reject, some types of chemotherapy drugs. P-glycoprotein also makes the cells reject sestamibi.~Some drugs, including a drug called tariquidar, may block the pumping action of P-glycoprotein, giving the chemotherapy more time to work. Tariquidar can also help sestamibi stay in the cells longer.~Objectives:~-To evaluate the use of sestamibi for determining if chemotherapy is being rejected and if enough of the blocking drugs are present to stop the rejection.~Eligibility:~-Patients18 years of age and older with a tumor 2 cm or larger who are enrolled in or are eligible for enrollment in an active National Cancer Institute treatment protocol.~Design:~Patients have two scans, one before receiving any drugs and a second 1-2 hours after receiving tariquidar. The second scan is done 72 or more hours after the first. For both scans, Tc-94m sestamibi is injected into a vein and a series of pictures are taken with an imaging camera called a PET (positron emission tomography) scanner. The pictures show where the sestamibi distributes in the body and monitors the effects of tariquidar on drug resistance. Blood samples are collected during the scan to examine the effect of tariquidar on P-glycoprotein in normal cells.~Some patients may be asked to undergo a tumor biopsy to test for the presence of the P-glycoprotein on their cancer cells.

By taking pictures of the DAT, scientists hope to learn more about the function of these neurons.~Normal, healthy volunteers between 18 and 65 years of age may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a medical history and physical examination, psychological assessment, and blood and urine tests.~Subjects enrolled in the study participate in one of the following procedures:~Brain Imaging Study: Part 1~Two catheters (small plastic tubes) are placed into veins in the subject's arms for injecting [18F]FECNT and for collecting blood samples during the scan. A third catheter is placed into a wrist artery to obtain arterial blood during the scan. With the catheters in place, the subject lies down on the scanner bed with his or her head placed in a special mask that limits movement during the brain scan.

They are monitored throughout the procedure. Vital signs are measured and electrocardiogram is taken once before and twice after injection of the tracer. At the end of the scanning, additional blood and urine samples are collected. Subjects are asked to urinate every 2 hours to lessen the radioactivity in the body.~Whole Body Imaging Study: Part 2~For this procedure, a catheter is placed in a vein for injecting the [18F]FECNT tracer. A total of five scans are taken, each one spanning from head to upper thigh. During the course of the scans, x-ray like pictures are obtained. The first scan takes about 100 minutes. Four additional 1-hour scans are done every 100 minutes. The total time for the scans is about 6 hours, and the total time for the entire procedure is about 9 hours. About 2 tablespoons of blood are drawn by needle stick at one time during the imaging. Subjects can leave the PET scanner between scans.

Subjects lie on a bed that slides in and out of the doughnut-shaped scanner, with their head held from the back by a padded holder and in front by a custom-molded plastic mask with holes for the eyes, nose, and mouth. DC electrodes made of wet sponges are placed on the right side of the head and over the left eye and are held in place with elastic bandages.~Three kinds of DC polarization are tested. In two tests the current is the same, but in opposite directions. The third is a sham (placebo) condition with no current delivered. Each of the three scans is separated by at least 3 days. On each day, a series of scans is done in a single session. Before each injection of tracer, the DC current is turned on. This may cause a tingling or slight burning on the skin under the electrodes, which disappears when the current is turned off. In each session, the subject receives 16 injections of tracer about 8 minutes apart, with DC polarization turned on for 4 out of the 8 minutes.~During most of the 8-minute periods, subjects are shown a pattern of dots about every 2 seconds. Sometimes the subject just looks at the patterns, and sometimes subjects are asked to push a button corresponding to the pattern they saw just before the current one. Sometimes they will be asked to push a button corresponding to the pattern that came before that one and so on, up to three patterns before the current one.

Participants undergo the following procedures in three visits:~Visit 1~Patients have touch (sensory) testing inside the mouth using three methods: 1) applying a temperature probe onto the gums and having the patient rate how warm it is; 2) applying a gentle stroke across the gums with the bristles of a small paint brush and having the patient say whether or not it feels painful; and 3) applying a light touch to the gums with a small needle and having the patient rate the pain intensity following the touch. Following touch testing, the patient's mouth is numbed with an anesthetic and a small piece of gum tissue next to the lower wisdom tooth is removed (biopsied). Then, a small amount of either capsaicin or placebo (saline, or salt water) is injected next to the wisdom tooth.~Visit 2~Following repeat the touch testing, patients are sedated with an injection of midazolam. They then have another biopsy under local anesthesia on the same side of the mouth as the first biopsy. Their mouth is again numbed with an anesthetic, and they are given either a pain-relieving medicine called Toradol or a placebo injected into the arm. One lower wisdom tooth is then extracted. After the extraction, pain ratings are recorded every 20 minutes for up to 6 hours. During this time, patients are monitored for vital signs, numbness, pain, and side effects. Patients who request pain-relief medication are given acetaminophen and codeine. At the end of the study, they are discharged from the clinic and given acetaminophen and codeine to take at home, as instructed. They are provided a pain diary to record pain ratings and any adverse reactions that might occur until the last visit.~Visit 3~Patients return for a follow-up evaluation 48 hours after discharge from the clinic. At the end of the evaluation, they are discharged home with flurbiprofen for pain relief. Remaining wisdom teeth are removed off-study no sooner than 1 week following the first visit.\"},\n",

The researchers for this study hypothesize that a similar system pertains to observing and experiencing touch.~Patients ages 18 to 75 years old who are in good health, are right handed, and who are able to perform simple tasks that require attention may be eligible for this study. Pregnant women are not eligible.~Patients who have not had a health screening at NIH will undergo a clinical and neurological exam. Women of childbearing potential will also have a pregnancy test. The screening will take about 2 to 3 hours. A diagnostic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan will be performed if patients have not undergone one in the previous 12 months. During the procedure, patients will lie still on a table that will slide into the enclosed tunnel of the scanner. They will be asked to lie as still as possible for up to a few minutes at a time. As the scanner takes pictures, patients will hear knocking or beeping sounds, and they will wear earplugs to reduce the noise. Patients will be able to communicate with the MRI staff at all times during the scan, and they may ask to be moved out of the machine at any time. This scan will take about 2 hours.~Two sessions are involved in the study. The first one is intended to familiarize patients with the procedure. During it, they will learn about hand stimulus, through watching a video showing the index finger of a hand being touched by a stick repeatedly. Then the activity will be repeated, but this time, a researcher will also touch the patient's index finger while he or she is watching the video. This session will take about 1 hour.~The second session consists of a functional MRI scan, or fMRI. During it, pictures of the brain will be taken while patients perform tasks. All tasks will be explained in advance, and patients will have an opportunity to practice them before entering the scanner. The fMRI scan will take 1 to 2 hours.~The researchers will discuss the results of the tests with the participants. There is not a direct benefit to those who take part in the study. However, it is hoped that resulting information will enhance researchers' understanding about how the brain processes observed information.\"},\n",

It will also examine brain areas relating to a person's knowledge of how likeable those personality traits are, being familiar with the traits, and the degree of associating such traits with one's self. There has not been any previous study, through modern imaging techniques, on the location of the brain and the concepts of personality traits.~Patients ages 21 to 65 who are in good health, are right handed, and native speakers of English may be eligible for this study. Pregnant women are not eligible. There will be 200 participants involved in pencil-and-paper or computer tasks. Also, there will be three functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments with 32 participants. Patients may participate in up to three fMRI experiments.~Patients will be recruited through NIH's Normal Control Database. They would need to have had a neuroexamination conducted by an NIH doctor within the last year. Patients will be interviewed for any medical, neurological, or psychological condition that would make it difficult to read the fMRI results. Depending on the studies that patients take part in, they will have different questionnaires to complete. They may also perform a computerized test that measures word associations. These tests will take about 1 to 2 hours.~The technique of MRI uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to obtain images of body organs and tissues. During the initial MRI scan, patients will lie still on a table that will slide into the enclosed tunnel of the scanner. They will be in the scanner not longer than 2 hours. During the procedure, they may be asked to lie as still as possible for up to 1 hour at a time. As the scanner takes pictures, patients will hear knocking or beeping sounds, and they will wear earplugs to reduce the noise. Patients will be able to communicate with the MRI staff at all times during the scan, and they may ask to be moved out of the machine at any time. Then the functional MRI (fMRI) scan will involve taking pictures of the brain while patients are performing tasks. All the tasks will be explained, and patients will have the chance to practice them before entering the scanner. For this activity, patients will be asked to make decisions about what they are seeing in the tasks presented to them. They will decide yes and no by pressing a left or right button. This scan will take about 1 hour. Afterward, patients may be asked to fill out written questionnaires or to perform reaction time tasks by using a computer.~This study will not have a direct benefit for participants. However, it is hoped that information gained will enhance researchers' understanding about which areas of the brain are necessary to perform certain tasks.\"},\n",

Moving to a new work location may require physical activity that is different from what employees currently experience on the job.

       "  'brief_summary': \"Objectives: The purpose of this study is to identify areas of brain activation during the urge to yawn. Little is known about how yawning is suppressed, or why yawning often occurs in response to seeing another person yawn (contagious yawning). Contagious yawning is similar to other contagious motor programs, such as the greater urge Tourette subjects feel to tic when seeing repetitive movements or other subjects' tics, the urge to scratch when discussing itching and scratching, or the urge to urinate when hearing running water. Hypothetically, the urge or the suppression of this urge is modulated by a common cortical circuit implicated in Tourette syndrome. We plan to use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to identify the pattern of blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) activation in the brain when normal volunteers feel the urge to yawn.~Study Population: We intend to study 25 normal, right-handed, healthy volunteers.~Study Design: Using an event-related design, we will scan subjects, using the same 3T fMRI scanner, while showing a video of a person yawning, gaping, coughing, or doing nothing. Each of these four action stimuli will last for four seconds, with varying interstimulus intervals. Each video set will contain all actions displayed ten times pseudorandomly. Two data sets will be collected from each subject and will be separated by a brief rest period. Subjects will be instructed before the scan to watch a videotaped person perform various behaviors, without detailing the specific actions. So as not to influence their natural response to the yawning stimulus, we will instruct them only to keep their head still. The variable of interest will be the activation during urge-generation, contrasted with other control stimuli. A survey will be administered for informational purposes following the scan to assess the subjects' general impression of their susceptibility to yawning, whether they yawned in the scanner, whether they suppressed the urge to yawn, and if the urge to yawn increased or decreased with the repetition of the yawning segment.~Outcome Measures: The primary outcome of this study is the activation of brain structures in response to viewing another person yawning. In particular, we are interested in the activation of the anterior cingulate cortex, parietal operculum, insula, supplementary motor area, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex as these are areas implicated in the urge to move in response to either internal (as in Tourette syndrome) or external (as in itching from histamine injection) states. Since the urge to yawn is the process of interest, suppression of yawning is not relevant to the fMRI analysis.\"},\n",

A person's health is affected not only by being able to receive health care but also by several factors such as income and education. People with lower incomes have been found to be not as healthy as those with higher incomes. While the governments of many countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development are currently working on public policy to address this topic, the likelihood is small that the United States, given its market-based economy, will do the same. However, owing to the heavy reliance in the United States on employer-sponsored health insurance, it would be useful to explore the possibility of insuring some of the measures that people can take to improve their health, and to do that through employee benefit packages. Solutions might include extended unemployment insurance, more education, job training, exercise programs, help for housing, disability insurance, and extra retirement benefits.~Adults who have a minimum of a sixth-grade reading level, have low incomes, are English speaking may be eligible for this study. For recruitment, 400 people who live and work in the Washington, D.C, area will be invited to participate, and about12 people will take part in each session. Unless people in the study participate during working hours, they will each be paid $75 at the conclusion of the session.~The study consists of one phase, in which participants will engage in a group exercise that lasts for approximately 2-1/2 hours. During that time, participants will have the chance to say what employee benefits they would choose, if the opportunity arose, to improve their health. They will first make those choices by themselves and then make choices along with other people in the group. While group members talk, the discussion will be recorded on a tape recorder. Participants will be asked to give information about themselves and their opinions but will not be asked for any information that identifies them personally, except for data needed to pay participants with a paycheck. They will also get to use a computer and will be shown how to use it, if necessary. If videotaping or photographs are done during the exercise, the investigators of the study will ask for separate signed permission to do so. Participants will be asked to respect the privacy of others in the group and to not discuss the opinions of others after leaving the session.\"},\n",

       "  'brief_summary': 'Maraviroc (UK-427,857), a selective and reversible CCR5 coreceptor antagonist, has been shown to be active in vitro against a wide range of clinical isolates (including those resistant to existing classes). In HIV-1 infected patients, maraviroc (UK-427,857) given as monotherapy for 10 days reduced HIV-1 viral load by up to 1.6 log, consistent with currently available agents. Safety and toleration have been studied in over 400 subjects for up to 28 days at 300 mg twice daily. No significant effects were seen on the QTc interval. The goal of this study is to compare the safety and efficacy of maraviroc (UK-427,857) versus efavirenz, when each are combined with two other antiretroviral agents, in patients who are previously naive to antiretroviral therapy. This study will involve approximately 200 centers from around the world to achieve a total randomized subject population of 1071 subjects. Patients will be randomly assigned to one of three groups: maraviroc (UK-427,857) 300 mg once daily added to zidovudine/lamivudine (300 mg/150 mg twice daily), Maraviroc (UK-427,857) 300 mg twice daily added to zidovudine/lamivudine (300 mg/150 mg twice daily) or efavirenz (600 mg once daily) added to zidovudine/lamivudine (300 mg/150 mg twice daily). The study will enroll over approximately an 18 month period (5 months Phase 2b run-in, 13 months Phase 3) with 96 weeks of treatment. This may be extended for an additional 3 years depending on the results at 96 weeks. Physical examinations will be performed at study entry, weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 32, 40, 48, 60, 72, 84 and 96. Blood samples will also be taken at study entry, weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 32, 40, 48, 60, 72, 84 and 96. Additionally, blood samples will be drawn twice, at least 30 minutes apart, at weeks 2 and 48 for maraviroc (UK-427,857) pharmacokinetic analysis. As part of this clinical study a blood sample will be taken for non-anonymized pharmacogenetic analysis. Patients will undergo a 12-lead electrocardiogram at study entry, weeks 24, 48 and 96. A computerized tomography (CT) scan will also be performed, at selected centers, at study entry and week 96.

       "  'brief_summary': \"This study will test whether an experimental vaccine to protect against severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is safe, causes any side effects, and causes an immune response. SARS affects the respiratory system, usually starting with fever and muscle aches. Patients may get a dry cough and have difficulty breathing. Infection may be mild, but it can lead to death.~Vaccines contain substances from an infectious agent, such as a virus, that, when injected into a person's body, stimulates production of antibodies that create resistance, or immunity, to that agent. The vaccine in this study contains genetic material (DNA) that codes for a protein found in the virus that causes SARS. Injected into a muscle, it instructs the body to make a small amount of a SARS protein. The vaccine is made from just one small part of the code for one SARS protein; a person cannot get SARS from the vaccine.~Normal volunteers between 18 and 50 years of age who are in general good health may be eligible for this 32-week study. Candidates are screened with a physical examination and blood and urine tests.~Participants have nine clinic visits during the study. They receive three vaccine injections, given with a system called the Bioinjector 2000® (Registered Trademark), which delivers the vaccine through the skin without the use of a needle. Following each injection, participants take home a diary card, on which they record their temperature and any vaccine side effects daily for 5 days. Participants must immediately report any symptoms to a study physician, and, if necessary, go to the clinic for an examination. Participants have the following tests and procedures:~Vaccine injections (study day 0, around week 4, and around week 8, with at least 21 days between injections)~Medical history and, if needed, physical examination (study day 0 and weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24, and 32)~Check of vital signs and weight (study day 0 and weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24 and 32)~Lymph node examination (day 0 and weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12)~Blood draw (study day 0 and weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24 and 32)~Pregnancy test for women (day 0 and weeks 4, 8 and 32)~Urine sample (day 0 and weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10)\"},\n",

Poor communication between healthcare providers at hospital discharge is common and contributes to adverse events affecting patients after discharge. The importance of good communication at discharge will increase as more primary care providers delegate inpatient care to hospitalists. Any process that improves information transfer among providers at discharge might improve the health and safety of patients discharged from U.S. hospitals each year, and to appreciably reduce unnecessary healthcare expenditures. Information transfer among healthcare providers and their patients can be undermined because of inaccuracies, omissions, illegibility, logistical failure (e.g., information is never delivered), and delays in generation (i.e., dictation or transcription) or transmission. Root causes include recall error, increased physician workloads, interface failures (e.g., physician-clerical) and poor training of physicians in the discharge process. Many of the deficiencies in the current process of information transfer at hospital discharge could be effectively addressed by the application of information technology. The proposed study will measure the value of a software application to facilitate information transfer at hospital discharge. The study is designed to compare the benefits of discharge health information technology versus usual care in high-risk patients recently discharged from acute care hospitalization. The design is a randomized, single-blind, controlled trial. The outcomes are readmission within 6 months, adverse events, and effectiveness and satisfaction with the discharge process from the patient and physician perspectives.

Five elements of children's involvement in the decision-making process with respect to their participation in clinical research will be assessed: 1) receipt of information concerning the available options; 2) understanding of this information; 3) assessment of the available options; 4) expression of a preferred option; and 5) coordination with parental decision-making.~Three groups will be enrolled: 1. Minor/Parent pairs where the minor is participating in, or is in follow-up for, a drug treatment research study for cancer 2. Minor/Parent pairs where the minor is participating in, or is in follow-up for, a drug treatment research study for asthma, and 3. Minor/Parent pairs where the minor is receiving on-going clinical care for asthma. Children 7-14 years of age will be enrolled. Total enrollment will be 400 subject pairs, approximately 150 in cancer research, 150 in asthma research and 100 involved in clinical care for asthma, with approximate balance between the sites. Two formalized survey instruments - research/clinical minor, research/clinical parent - will be developed in consultation with Research Triangle Institute (RTI).\"},\n",

       "  'brief_summary': 'This study will examine 1) how nitrite (a natural blood substance that relaxes blood vessels) increases blood flow and lowers blood pressure, and 2) how to increase the effects of nitrite on blood pressure.~Healthy volunteers between 21 and 40 years of age may be eligible for this study. They must be non-smokers and have no history of high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or diabetes. Candidates are screened with a medical history, physical examination, electrocardiogram, and blood tests. This study is either done in the NIH Clinical Center intensive care unit or on the general clinical ward. Participants are enrolled in Part A of the study. After completion of Part A participants will be enrolled in Part B of the study.~Part A:~Participants lie in a reclining chair during the study. Small catheters (plastic tubes) are inserted into an artery and vein in the forearm. Another tube is placed in the vein of the opposite arm. Blood pressure cuffs are placed around the upper arm and wrist, and a strain gauge (a rubber band-like device) is placed around the forearm. This device helps us to measure blood flow through the arm. When the blood pressure cuffs are inflated, blood flows into the forearm, stretching the strain gauge at a rate proportional to the blood flow. Pressure cuffs and a strain gauge are also placed on the other arm. After 20 minutes, blood pressure and blood flow are measured in both forearms. Then blood is drawn from the tube in the right vein to measure blood counts, proteins, and other chemicals. Participants then are given small doses of either saline, ascorbic acid, or a medicine called oxypurinol, a form of a drug that is often taken to prevent gout. After 30 minutes, sodium nitrite is injected in increasing doses into the artery for 30 minutes. Blood flow is measured and blood is drawn every 5 minutes during the infusion. At the end of the 30 minutes, blood is drawn from the vein every 30 minutes for 3 hours. After 3 hours, sodium nitrite infusions are restarted for 2 hours and blood flow is measured and samples collected every 30 minutes during this period.~Part B: Participants lie in a reclining chair during the study. A small catheter (plastic tube) is placed in the artery of the left forearm to draw blood samples. A larger catheter called a central line is placed in a deeper vein in the neck. Another tube is advanced through the central line into the chambers of the heart, through the heart valve, and into the lung artery to measure pressures in the heart and lungs. Blood is drawn after 30 minutes to obtain baseline measurements. Then saline (sterile salt water) is put into the tube in the lung artery. Blood pressure cuffs are placed around the upper arm and wrist, and a strain gauge (a rubber band-like device) is placed around the forearm, which helps us to measure flow through the arm. When the cuffs are inflated, blood flows into the forearm, stretching the strain gauge at a rate proportional to the blood flow. Pressure cuffs and a strain gauge are also placed on the other arm. After 20 minutes, blood pressure and blood flow are measured in the forearm and blood samples are drawn from the tube in the left artery to measure blood counts, proteins, and other chemicals.~Subjects then breathe a mixture of oxygen and nitrogen through a facemask for 30 minutes, then room air for 30 minutes, and then the oxygen and nitrogen mixture for another 30 minutes. While breathing the mixture the second time, sodium nitrite is injected through the tube in the artery in three increasing doses for 5 minutes each. Every 5 minutes during the infusion blood is drawn from the tubes in the neck. Forearm blood flow is also measured every 5 minutes. After 30 minutes, the subject breathes room air for 3 hours and 15 minutes and then the sodium nitrite is injected again in three increasing doses for 5 minutes each. Every 5 minutes during the infusion blood is taken from the tube in the neck and forearm blood flow is measured'},\n",

       "  'brief_summary': \"This study will examine whether surface electrical stimulation on the skin of the throat will: 1) move the larynx (voice box); 2) move the vocal folds in the larynx; and 3) cause less movement of the larynx when applied during swallowing. It is important that the larynx moves up and forward while swallowing so that food does not go into the airway. A device called VitalStim® (Registered Trademark), which provides electrical stimulation to the skin on the neck and under the chin, is widely used to treat people who have problems swallowing. This study will determine if VitalStim can move the voice box or the vocal folds in the larynx. This information is important for patients who have long-term problems raising or closing their larynxes when they swallow.~Healthy volunteers between 20 and 60 years of age may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a medical history, physical examination, electrocardiogram, and nasoendoscopy. For the latter procedure, the inside of the subject's nose is sprayed with a decongestant, opening the nasal passages. A small flexible tube called a nasoendoscope is passed through the nose to the back of the throat. The scope allows observation of the larynx while the subject speaks, sings, whistles and makes prolonged vowel sounds.~Participants are familiarized with the VitalStim device before beginning the experimental procedures. The device consists of two sets of electrodes and a stimulation unit. The electrodes are placed on the neck and under the chin. Stimulation causes different sensations, according to the intensity level. They include tingling/crawling, vibrating warm/burning, and grabbing. Subjects then undergo the following procedures:~Nasoendoscopy with muscle stimulation: The inside of the nose is sprayed with a decongestant and the nasoendoscope is passed through one nostril to the back of the throat. Electrodes are placed on the throat area and under the chin. Stimulation is delivered 10 times at various places on the neck and under the chin while the subject sits quietly. This test shows if the vocal folds in the voice box move with surface electrical stimulation.~Videofluoroscopy with muscle stimulation at rest and during swallowing: This is an x-ray study of the head and neck during swallowing and at rest to determine how stimulation affects the level of the voice box in the neck. Electrodes are placed under the chin and on the throat. The subject swallows 5 milliliters of barium, a contrast material that can be seen easily on x-ray. The x-ray machine is turned on for a few seconds at a time during each swallow of the barium and another 10 times while the subject is remaining still without swallowing.\"},\n",

       "  'brief_summary': \"This study will examine the effect of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) on short-term memory in healthy adults. Healthy people use their brains to answer short-term memory questions in a different way than do patients with schizophrenia. Attention and memory deficits in schizophrenia patients significantly hamper their recovery and rehabilitation, yet there are no effective treatments for these impairments. TMS is a method of brain stimulation that may be able to change the electrical activity of the nerve cells of the brain and improve certain brain functions. This study will explore the effect of TMS on memory and perhaps discover brain processes that may be helpful in developing new ways to treat schizophrenia.~Healthy volunteers between 18 and 55 years of age, excluding pregnant women, may be eligible for this study. Participants undergo the following tests and procedures:~Medical history, physical examination, blood tests, electrocardiogram (EKG), and urine pregnancy test for women of childbearing age.~Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and functional MRI (fMRI). These tests are done in participants who have not had structural and functional MRIs as participants in NIMH's 2-day schizophrenia study within 90 days of entering the current study. MRI is done to locate the place in the brain to simulate with TMS and fMRI is done to look at brain activity while the subject solves short-term memory tasks. Both tests are done at the same session. Before the scan, four vitamin E capsules are taped to the subject's scalp. After the capsules are in place, the subject lies on a stretcher that is moved into the scanner - a narrow cylinder with a strong magnetic field. During the scan, subjects are asked to do some simple tests, such as watching pictures on a screen or pressing buttons in response to numbers they were shown a few seconds earlier. Scanning may take up to 2 hours, but usually lasts between 45 and 90 minutes.~TMS. For this procedure, subjects receive either active TMS or a sham procedure (placebo) that imitates TMS but does not use real electrical stimulation. For TMS, an insulated wire coil is placed on the scalp and a brief electrical current is passed through it. This generates magnetic pulses that travel through the scalp and skull and cause small electrical currents in the cortex, or outer part of the brain. The stimulation may cause muscle twitching in the scalp or face and may also cause small movement of the limbs. During the procedure, electrodes are taped to the scalp to record the electrical activity of the brain while short-term memory is tested. Two tests make up a set. There are a total of six test sets; each set takes about 3 minutes. Five periods of electrical stimulation are delivered before each test set. Each period of stimulation lasts 5 seconds, followed by a 10-second rest period. The stimulation-rest intervals continue until five periods of TMS have been applied. For the memory test, subjects press a key on a computer keyboard as quickly and accurately as possible in a test of their ability to remember a string of numbers, or letters.~Questionnaires. At the beginning and end of the TMS session, participants fill out questionnaires that assess their mood, ability to concentrate, and level of anxiety.\"},\n",

Exercise ability is limited by how fast oxygen can be delivered to the body and how fast the body can produce energy. Both of these processes are affected by nitric oxide (NO), a gas produced by cells that line blood vessels. NO is important in regulating blood vessel dilation, and consequently, blood flow. Nitrite may act as a storehouse for nitric oxide and be able to improve exercise tolerance.~Healthy normal volunteers between 21 and 45 years of age who can use an exercise bicycle may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a medical history, physical examination, electrocardiogram, breathing tests, blood tests, and a pregnancy test for women who are able to bear children. Pregnant women are excluded from the study. The screening session includes practice exercise on the bicycle.~Participants exercise on a stationery exercise bicycle for about 30 minutes on each of two study days. During the test, they breathe in and out of a mouthpiece that allows inhaled and exhaled respiratory gases to be measured. Before subjects begin to exercise, a small tube is placed in the artery of their forearm inside the elbow. A longer tube called a central line is placed in a deeper vein in the neck after the area has been numbed. A thinner tube, called a pulmonary artery catheter, is placed through the central line and advanced into the chambers of the heart, through the heart valve, and into the lung artery. This catheter measures various pressures directly in the heart and lungs. Blood samples are drawn through the catheter also, to avoid the need for multiple needle sticks. Another tube is placed in the vein of the other arm to deliver medications.~Thirty minutes after all the tubes are placed, a blood sample is drawn for baseline measurements. Then, either saline (sterile salt water) or nitrite is injected into the tube in the arm vein. Thirty minutes after the injection, the subject starts exercising on the bicycle. The work setting on the bicycle is increased every minute, and the subject pedals until he or she is too tired to continue. During the test, a small blood sample is collected every 2 minutes. Heart rate, blood pressure, and heart rhythms are continuously monitored.~After the test on the first day, participants are admitted to the hospital to rest for the remainder of the afternoon and evening. The tubes are kept in place for the following morning, when the procedure is repeated exactly as before, except that subjects who received saline the first day are given nitrite the second day, and vice versa.~...'},\n",

The study will also monitor participants for the social impact of being in an HIV vaccine study (e.g., problems with insurance, health care, friends, family, employment, housing, and so forth). The study vaccine is made using an adenovirus (a common virus that causes upper respiratory infections, such as the common cold, eye infection, urine infection or diarrhea) that has been modified to contain DNA that codes for three HIV proteins. The modified virus cannot reproduce in the body and cannot cause HIV disease or adenoviral infections.~Healthy volunteers who previously received three injections of the VRC-HIVDNA016-00-VP under the NIAID study VRC 007 (protocol 04-I-0254) may be eligible for this study.~Participants receive one injection of the adenoviral vector vaccine. It is given the day they enroll in the study, as a single injection in an upper arm muscle. Also on that day they have a brief physical examination, medical history, blood and urine tests, pregnancy test for women, and counseling, as needed, about HIV and pregnancy avoidance. Subjects are observed for side effects for at least 30 minutes after the vaccination and are required to telephone the clinic staff 1 to 2 days after the injection for follow-up. In addition, they are given a diary card to take home, on which they record their temperature and any symptoms daily for 5 days.~Subjects return to the clinic for 5 follow-up visits at weeks 2, 4, 6, 12 and 24 after the injection. At each visit they are checked for health changes or problems since the last visit, asked how they are feeling and what medications they are taking. They have blood drawn at every visit and urine samples collected at most visits. They are tested for HIV three or more times and are questioned about their sexual behavior and drug use. They also complete a social impact questionnaire at the last visit.~Subjects are asked to undergo apheresis at the week 4 visit. This procedure allows collection of a larger number of white blood cells than can be obtained by a simple blood draw. The white cells are studied to see how the immune system responds to the study vaccine. For apheresis, blood is collected through a needle in an arm vein and spun in a machine that separates the components. The white blood cells are extracted and the rest of the blood is returned to the body through the same needle. Subjects who do not undergo apheresis have about 1/3 cup of blood sample drawn using a needle.'},\n",

       "  'brief_summary': \"This 1-week study will test the safety and dosing of an anticoagulation system called REG1 that is designed to improve control of blood thinning. Patients with heart attack and other conditions require treatment with an anticoagulant (blood thinner) to prevent the formation of blood clots. However, anticoagulation therapy can increase the risk of bleeding. The REG1 system is designed to minimize this risk. One part of the system stops the activity of factor IX (a protein that helps blood clot) while the other part of the system (the antidote) inactivates the drug and stops the thinning process. This study will examine in normal healthy subjects how the REG1 system works in the body and how it leaves the body.~Healthy normal volunteers between 12 and 65 years of age who weigh 50-120 kilograms (110-264 pounds) and have no history of bleeding problems or significant bleeding may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a medical history, physical examination, and blood tests.~Participants must avoid foods that may alter the blood's clotting ability and must not take any medications the week of the study. They undergo the following tests and procedures:~Day 1~Subjects are admitted to the NIH Clinical Center for an overnight stay. Two catheters (plastic tubes) are placed in the subject's arm veins, one for drawing blood samples and the other for injecting one of the following: REG1 drug, REG1 antidote, REG1 drug and antidote, or placebo. Two injections of study medication are given, spaced 3 hours apart, each over a 1-minute period. After each injection, blood is collected at specific times to measure levels of the drug or antidote in the body and the blood's ability to clot. Subjects also provide a 24-hour urine collection and stool sample.~Day 2~A blood sample is drawn 24 hours after the drug or antidote injection from the previous day. If the blood test result is normal, subjects are discharged home with instructions to follow. They return to the Clinical Center at 36 hours and 48 hours for additional blood samples.~Days 3 and 7~A blood sample is collected at the end of day 3 and day 7. Urine and stool samples are also collected.\"},\n",

Relatives of patients and normal healthy volunteers will also be enrolled.~Individuals will undergo one of the following two apheresis procedures:~Automated pheresis Blood is drawn through a needle placed in an arm vein and circulated through a cell separator machine. The plasma (liquid part of the blood) and white cells are extracted, and the red cells are re-infused into the donor through the same needle or a needle in the other arm. An anticoagulant (medication to prevent blood from clotting) is usually added to the blood while in the machine to prevent it from clotting during processing.~Manual pheresis One unit (1 pint) of blood is drawn through a needle placed in an arm vein, similar to donating a pint of whole blood. The red blood cells, with or without plasma, are separated from the rest of the blood and returned to the donor through the same needle. Manual pheresis will be done only when a person s estimated total blood volume or red cell count is too low to safely permit removal of blood through a pheresis machine. An adult small in size or markedly anemic, for example, may fall into this category.~Some of the blood collected through apheresis may be stored for future studies of HIV disease and immune function and for HLA testing, a genetic test of markers of the immune system.

       "  'brief_summary': \"This study will investigate the spatio-temporal characteristics of brain activity during sleep. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have shown that in the absence of external stimuli, the brain continues to show spatial patterns of activity that resemble those during sensory and cognitive tasks. This phenomenon greatly affects the interpretation of neuroimaging studies based on positive emission tomography (PET) and fMRI, which rely on the contrast between brain activity during a task and activity during rest. In addition, resting state activity in itself may reveal information on the large-scale organization of neuronal networks and on functional abnormalities related to disease.~Participants should represent a broad cross section of the healthy adult population. Any neurologically and psychiatrically healthy male or nonpregnant female between 18 and 65 years old may be eligible.~Studies will be conducted in the In Vivo NMR Research Center. Concurrent electroencephalogram (EEG) and MRI studies will last between 1 and 2 hours. A typical study involves 15 minutes of anatomical MRI scanning followed by a 60-minute functional scan during which the subject relaxes with eyes closed and is encouraged to sleep while the fMRI/EEG are performed. Participants may be scanned 1 to 20 times. No more than 1 scan will be performed per day and no more than 20 scans will be performed within a year. During the last 5 to 10 minutes of the scan, the participant will open his or her eyes and actively participate in a visual stimulation or attention task. The participant's alertness will be measured by a behavioral (button-press) response. The visual stimuli (contrast reversing checkerboard displays, alternated with uniform grey fields) will be presented using the standard projection system available with the MRI scanner. The attention task will involve repeated visual presentation of groups of letters and digits; the participant will be asked about the correspondence between these groups.~Magnetoencephalogram (MEG) scans will be performed on some participants. The precise and undistorted signals available with MEG will be used to enhance the interpretation of alertness and sleep-related characteristics of the EEG signals, which can vary quite dramatically across subjects. In addition, the MEG signals will provide preliminary spatial localization of the sleep-dependent changes more precisely than is possible with EEG. MRI scanner noise will be simulated using tape recordings to allow comparison with the MRI/EEG data. MEG scans will last 45 minutes to 2 hours. At all times during any of the brain scans the participant will be able to communicate the MRI scientist or MEG/EEG technician and can ask to be removed from the device at any time.~The study will not have a direct benefit for participants. It may be help us learn more about brain function, which may lead to better treatments.\"},\n",

       "  'brief_summary': \"This study will determine how the brain controls movements by sending messages to the spinal cord and muscles. Researchers want to know if strengthening a hand muscle will increase the strength of the same muscle in the other hand, and if these changes happen in the brain or spine, or both. Plasticity in this study refers to the capacity for continuous changes of the neural pathways in the brain and nervous system. Researchers have seen cases in which using a muscle extensively (force production) in one muscle group has increased the strength of the same muscle group on the opposite side of the body (force transfer). This situation happens without the unused muscle becoming larger-suggesting that the practice causes changes in some parts of the brain or spine. It is vital for scientists to know how this effect works, so that they can create new rehabilitation methods for people who cannot move or who have difficulty moving one side of their body.~Patients ages 18 to 60 who are in good health and who do not have a history of major conditions affecting the bones, joints or nervous system may be eligible for this study. Patients will undergo a medical examination. There will be 1 or 2 testing sessions, 20 training sessions, and 1 or 2 final testing sessions, with patients being asked to come to the laboratory for as few as 4 times (about 10 hours total) or for up to 25 visits (about 20 hours total). The investigator will indicate which of six different groups that a patient is selected for.~During testing sessions, the strength of the pointer and little fingers in each hand will be determined through the use of very brief electrical pulses. There also will be transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and 1 Hz TMS. The researchers will place one or two wire coils on the patient's scalp and make marks on the scalp which will be removed at the end of the session. During the TMS, a brief electrical current is passed through the coil, creating a magnetic pulse that stimulates the brain. Patients will hear a click sound and feel a snapping sensation on the skin. They may also feel and see small twitches in the hand muscles, and the fingers or wrist may move. There will be a total of about 300 magnetic stimuli, at a rate of 10 pulses per minute. Patients will also have an electromyogram (EMG), a procedure recording electrical activity in the muscles that are activated by electrical or magnetic stimulation. Metal electrodes will be attached to the skin over the muscle. During the EMG, patients will be asked to tense certain muscles slightly. Depending on the group a patient is assigned to, he or she may be asked to use the right index finger by using voluntary muscle movement, electrical stimulation, his or her imagination, electrical stimulation of a different hand muscle, or voluntary movements immediately followed by repetitive TMS.~Regardless of group assignment, there will be five blocks of 10 repetitions of finger exercise per session, 200 per week, and 1,000 throughout the whole study. During the study sessions, patients will be able to talk and move around. They can take a break and leave the room if needed. In most cases, the session will take less than 2 hours. There also will be a control group whose members will not be training their fingers but who will participate only in the testing sessions. TMS is a safe procedure; however, strong contractions of scalp muscles have been known to cause headaches. Also, because of the distracting noise of the TMS, patients will be fitted with earplugs to wear during the procedure.~Compensation for research-related discomfort and inconvenience will be made to participants, with a maximum of $500 to $600, depending on assignment to groups. This study will not have a direct benefit for participants. However, researchers hope to gain information that will help them better understand how the two sides of the brain control movement and how they affect each other regarding movement control.\"},\n",

Females are not eligible, owing to the risks that thalidomide presents to unborn children. To minimize the risk of fetal malformations, male patients who participate must use a condom during sexual intercourse for 4 weeks following the study and must not donate blood for 4 weeks.~The medications used in the study will be given 1 hour before surgery. Then after the wisdom teeth are removed, a small piece of tubing will be placed into both sides of the patient's mouth where the teeth were removed. Every 20 minutes, for the next 6 hours, the researchers will collect inflammatory fluid from the tubing, to measure for changes in anti-inflammatory action. If they request pain relievers, patients will receive the medication ketorolac (Toradol), used for short-term treatment of moderately severe acute pain. Side effects of thalidomide include fatigue, dizziness, and rash. The use of ibuprofen and ketorolac may include the risk of gastrointestinal ulcers and bleeding. Diazepam can cause involuntary muscle movements and drowsiness, as well as dizziness lasting for up to 24 hours after it has been used as sedation. Patients will be instructed not to try to walk alone or to try to drive a vehicle during that period. Other risks related to participation in this study include those usually experienced with removal of wisdom teeth-that is, pain and swelling, bruising from insertion of the sedative into a vein (if needed), possible infection at the extraction site, prolonged bleeding, and numbness.~Benefits from participating are having wisdom teeth removed at no cost as well as close monitoring before and after surgery.

The long-term objective of this research is to provide patients with a simple coping strategy at the vulnerable time of large core biopsy in the hope that this behavioral intervention will carry over to recovery and future medical procedures. In the largest prospective randomized study of its kind, the researchers showed that a self-hypnotic intervention during percutaneous, image-guided vascular and renal interventions resulted in less pain and anxiety, greater hemodynamic stability, and fewer procedure interruptions. The positive effects of the short initial hypnotic intervention, which was structured in the procedure room, became more pronounced the longer the procedure lasted and carried over into the immediate post-procedure recovery. The investigators therefore challenge the current paradigms that long-lasting effects require intensive presurgical preparation.'},\n",

Researchers aim to learn about which areas of the brain are necessary to perform certain cognitive tasks-that is, relating to a person's thinking or remembering-especially visual and motor tasks. Because one way humans learn is by imitation, a mechanism is required to transfer the behavior the person adopts from others through observation. This type of learning could be based on a mechanism similar to that provided by mirror neurons. From previous studies it has been learned that the observation of hands and mouths has brought about the most effective ways of activating the mirror neurons.~Patients ages 21 to 55 who are in good health, are right handed, are not pregnant, and are native speakers of English may be eligible for this study. There will be about 24 participants.~Patients will undergo a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. Before the scan, they will complete a safety questionnaire about the presence of any metal in their bodies. Patients are at risk for injury from the MRI magnet if they have pacemakers, dental implants or other devices. Female patients will undergo a pregnancy test. The technique MRI uses includes a strong magnetic field and radio waves to obtain images of body organs and tissues. During the initial MRI scan, patients will lie still on a table that will slide into the enclosed tunnel of the scanner. They will be in the scanner for about an hour. During the procedure, they may be asked to lie as still as possible for up to 20 minutes at a time. As the scanner takes pictures, patients will hear knocking or beeping sounds. Each participant will wear earplugs to reduce this noise. They will be able to communicate with the MRI staff at all times during the scan, and they may ask to be removed from the machine at any time. The functional MRI (fMRI) scan will involve taking pictures of the brain while patients are performing tasks. All the tasks will be explained, and patients will have the chance to practice them before entering the scanner. During the fMRI, patients will view short film segments of people making gestures. Before and after the scan, patients will be asked to complete several short questionnaires. The testing sessions will take a total of about 2 hours.~Participants will receive compensation for their time and inconvenience, with a maximum payment of $200.

In order to overcome the high risk of fatal treatment-related complications, reduced intensity and nonmyeloablative conditioning regimens for allogeneic HSCT are currently being explored in various hematological malignancies including AML. At least for allogeneic HSCT in AML, the optimal dose-intensity of preparative regimens for disease control at an acceptable rate of treatment-related lethal complications has not been determined. The investigators, therefore, evaluated reduced intensity myeloablative conditioning with 8 Gy TBI and fludarabine in AML patients considered ineligible for conventional conditioning in a phase 2 trial (data published in BLOOD by Stelljes et al., 2005). The results suggest that with 8 Gy TBI/fludarabine, conditioning related and unrelated donor transplants can be performed in AML patients in first or second complete remission (CR) with a remarkably low 2-year non relapse mortality (NRM) and satisfactory disease control. Based on these data a randomized phase 3 trial for patients with AML in CR≥2 is currently being conducted by the Cooperative German Transplant Study Group comparing TBI 8 Gy/fludarabine to conventionally dosed conditioning with TBI 12 Gy/cyclophosphamide.'},\n",

In a recent report on emergency admissions to acute hospitals in London, the King's Fund concluded that taking better care of elderly patients with COPD could reduce pressures on acute hospitals, and suggested that identification of vulnerable patients with lung disease and pro-active, rather than reactive, management might reduce the chances of hospitalisation. In this study, the investigators wish to compare a group of patients with COPD who are managed in the normal way, with another group of patients with COPD who receive all interventions known to be of some benefit to those with this condition. This will include a pulmonary rehabilitation programme, intensive education regarding self care, targeted advice to their general practitioners regarding how best to manage COPD, and regular contact with specialist respiratory nurses who will support the patients in their own homes by a combination of home visits and telephone contact. The value of such a comprehensive intervention will be studied, in terms of both its ability to reduce admissions to the hospital and its impact on quality of life.\"},\n",

Development of new therapeutic approaches for locally advanced or metastatic gastric/gastroesophageal cancer, is clearly needed.~Despite its proven efficacy, ECF (epirubicin, cisplatin, and infusional 5-fluorouracil [5-FU]) has not been widely adopted in North America and is likely due to the technical difficulties and inconvenience associated with infusional chemotherapy. This study will substitute the oral chemotherapy drug capecitabine for infusional 5-FU in addition to substituting intravenous cisplatin with carboplatin (ECC - epirubicin, carboplatin and capecitabine).

Candidates must be 18 years of age or older. They are screened with a medical history and neurological examination.~Immediately after screening, participants undergo one or two of the following tests:~Transcranial magnetic stimulation: This procedure maps brain function. A wire coil is held on the scalp, and a brief electrical current is passed through the coil, creating a magnetic pulse that stimulates the brain. During the stimulation, the subject may be asked to tense certain muscles slightly or perform other simple actions. The stimulation may cause a twitch in muscles of the face, arm, or leg, and the subject may hear a click and feel a pulling sensation on the skin under the coil. During the stimulation, electrical activity of muscles is recorded with a computer, using electrodes (small metal disks) attached to the skin with tape.~Electromyography (EMG): This test measures the electrical activity of muscles and is used to diagnose problems with the nerves or muscles. For surface EMG, electrodes are filed with a conductive gel and taped to the skin. Needle EMG involves inserting a needle into a muscle to record the electrical activity. Single fiber EMG uses specialized needles that allow recording from single muscle fibers. The needle is inserted into a muscle and the subject is asked to tense that muscle slightly.~Nerve conduction study: This test measures the speed with which nerves conduct electrical impulses and the strength of the connection between the nerve and the muscle. It is done by taping wires on the skin to record the impulses and placing a probe on the skin to deliver a small electrical stimulus.~Near-nerve recording: This test is a nerve conduction study that is used to measure responses from very small nerves. It uses a needle placed under the skin to record the nerve response.~Quantitative sensory testing: This test measures how well the subject feels vibration and cold. A probe that can vibrate or cool down is attached to the subject's finger or foot. The subject presses a button when he or she feels the stimulus. A computer adjusts the intensity of the stimulus to find the lowest level the subject can feel.~Nerve ultrasound: This test uses sound waves to examine the nerves. Warm gel is applied to the skin and a probe is held on the skin surface.\"},\n",

We, the investigators at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, have developed a type of counseling we call Dignity Psychotherapy. It is intended to help cancer patients maintain or enhance a sense of purpose, meaning, and overall quality of life, despite having cancer. Supportive Psychotherapy is another type of counseling intended to help patients feel more at ease and express and reflect on any feelings or concerns they might have about their illness. Both of these types of counseling will be compared to Standard Palliative Care. We will look at how these types of treatments affect patients' mood, outlook, and quality of life.

       "  'brief_summary': 'Misoprostol (Cytotec®) is a synthetic prostaglandin E1 analog that has been marketed in the United States since 1988 as a gastric cytoprotective agent. In contradistinction to prostaglandin E2 preparations (dinoprostone, Prepidil, Cervidil), misoprostol is inexpensive and available in scored tablets that can be broken and inserted vaginally. Despite a focused campaign by the manufacturer to curtail its use in obstetric practice, misoprostol has, over the past several years, gained widespread acceptance as both a labor induction and a cervical ripening agent. Such off-label indication has been endorsed by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and other medical bodies. Recently, FDA approved a new label for the use of cytotec during pregnancy which removed pregnancy as a contraindication for its use. Vaginal administration seems to be more efficacious than when given orally, although there is the worry of uterine tachysystole and hyperstimulation with vaginal doses > 50-µg. The use of sublingual misoprostol for cervical ripening at term was recently investigated in two studies that compared it to the oral route, on the assumption that the sublingual route would have the higher efficacy of the vaginal route by avoiding the first pass effects of the gastrointestinal and hepatic systems, while having lower hyperstimulation rates by avoiding the direct effects on the cervix. In addition, the sublingual route would combine an easier administration with the added advantage of no restriction of mobility after administration. There has been no previous report in the literature comparing the use of misoprostol given sublingually to that given vaginally for the induction of labor at term. Our aim is to compare efficacy, safety and patient satisfaction with misoprostol given vaginally (the current standard) to that given sublingually.'},\n",

The controlled exposure variable is air concentration of office dust spiked with Glucan to simulate a worse case scenario.~Aim 1: Confirm or support the causality between objective effects and exposures to dust spiked with Glucan with focus on inflammatory responses. This is done by negation of the hypothesis that no significant effects are found for the variables in question.~Aim 2 is to estimate the thresholds and slopes of the DR relation for effect measures which show effects of exposures. At best the study will supply for each variable a zero response to clean air and three non-zero responses to dust. Thresholds and slopes are estimated graphically by linear regression or by an accumulated response model.~Aim 3 is a confirmation that atopic persons and histamine sensitive persons in nasal provocation tests have different responses in the effect measures showing significant effects of exposures to dust spiked with Glucan. Risk group status is therefore included in the analyses of the main variables as explaining variable.~Potential additional aim 4: Chemical and biological characterization of the office dust used in the study.~Aim 4 is an investigation of dose response relations for explorative measures, which in previous investigations have showed indications of a dose response relation. For these no a priory hypotheses exists and the analyses must be arranged ad hoc. The explaining variables are exposure and risk group status.~One challenge in investigations of unspecific effects caused by mixed exposures is that few specific objective effects measures are available and subjective measures have to be introduced. Therefore there is a need for developments of new objective measures of health effects of air pollution. Some of these are related to new biomarkers of respiratory effects in a bio-sample taken as condensed exhaled breath.~Aim 5: Developments of new objective measures of health effects of air pollution. After the experiment it will be investigated by logistic regression if a sensitivity index can be established.'},\n",

Citalopram is a racemic mixture of equal parts of the S(+) and R(-) enantiomers. The S(+) form (escitalopram) has been identified as being the active isomer and inhibitor of serotonin reuptake and consequently antidepressant activity is associated almost exclusively with the S-enantiomer. Escitalopram has been shown to be approximately twice as potent as citalopram at the primary, high-affinity binding site on the human serotonin transporter. Interestingly, investigations have suggested an antagonistic interaction of the R- and S-enantiomer at an allosteric binding site on the serotonin transporter. This antagonism has been shown in animal studies where the addition of R-citalopram to escitalopram treatments significantly counteracts the antidepressant and anti-anxiolytic effects of escitalopram. From these clinical and experimental data, the researchers can anticipate that escitalopram would increase cortisol and prolactin in the neuroendocrine challenge paradigm more effectively than citalopram.'},\n",

       "  'brief_summary': 'Background: Dexamethasone is a steroid, which is often given into the vein before chemotherapy to help control acute nausea and vomiting. It can also be given as an oral tablet for patients to take for the two days following chemotherapy to help minimise delayed nausea and vomiting. In chemotherapy regimens that cause high rates of nausea and vomiting, the use of dexamethasone is well proven. However, in chemotherapy regimens that generally cause only minimal to moderate rates of nausea and vomiting, the value of oral dexamethasone in the 48-hour period after chemotherapy is not well proven, although it is often prescribed. While dexamethasone does decrease nausea, it causes additional side-effects such as insomnia, indigestion, anxiety and mood changes. While patients with less vomiting and nausea are expected to have better quality of life (QOL), for patients with minimal nausea or vomiting, their QOL might be more affected by the side effects of the dexamethasone treatment than by the nausea.~Study Design: The study will be performed in patients who will be receiving first line chemotherapy treatment with a moderate risk of nausea/vomiting. Anti-nausea therapy for acute nausea/vomiting will be standardised and all patients will receive non-steroidal medication for delayed nausea control. Each patient will be randomly allocated to receive either oral dexamethasone or an identical appearing placebo tablet for two days after chemotherapy for the first cycle of chemotherapy, and then crossed over to the other treatment for the second cycle. Patients will complete QOL assessments, dexamethasone symptom and nausea and vomiting questionnaires, as well as nausea/vomiting diaries. This will enable the researchers to determine the effect of dexamethasone on nausea and vomiting and the impact of both the side effects of dexamethasone, and of nausea and vomiting, on QOL.~Objectives: The primary objectives are to determine patient preference for dexamethasone or placebo, and to compare changes in QOL after chemotherapy in patients who receive dexamethasone with those who receive placebo. The secondary objectives are: (1) to compare complete protection from delayed vomiting and severity of nausea; (2) to compare differences in the impact of nausea and vomiting on QOL, and (3) to compare differences in symptoms that have been associated with dexamethasone (insomnia, anxiety, agitation, mood, etc.) between patients receiving dexamethasone and those receiving placebo.~Significance: This study will provide data to evaluate whether the benefits of dexamethasone for delayed nausea and vomiting outweigh potential side effects in patients receiving chemotherapy with a moderate risk of causing nausea and vomiting. This addresses a problem that is important to a majority of patients receiving anticancer chemotherapy. If overall QOL is improved on dexamethasone, then it should be prescribed more frequently, but if QOL is reduced on dexamethasone, and patients prefer the placebo, then its use as an anti-nausea medication for delayed nausea after moderately nauseating chemotherapy should be limited to patients with poor initial control of nausea/vomiting.'},\n",

The goal is to validate a survey instrument that can be applied to other workplace settings to measure productivity losses associated with controlling and aggressive behavior, which will serve to inform the development of workplace interventions designed to prevent intimate partner violence (IPV). This pilot-test will include two components of a survey conducted with employees in a workplace setting: questions to determine one's controlling behavior or propensity for violence in an intimate relationship, and questions designed to assess levels of productivity as measured by days missed from work (absenteeism) and days at work with diminished functional output (presenteeism). We expect productivity to decrease as one's controlling behavior or propensity for perpetrating IPV increases. This study represents one of the first workplace surveys designed to measure workplace productivity as a function of controlling or violent behavior. Successful results would argue for a more wide-scale testing of the instrument, which could ultimately lead to the development of workplace interventions designed to prevent IPV.\"},\n",

       "  'brief_summary': \"QUESTION:~Is controlled tidal volume delivery during the resuscitation of preterm infants < 28 weeks' gestation safe and feasible?~BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE: Current resuscitation of preterm neonates follows the Neonatal Resuscitation Program (NRP) guidelines. During initial resuscitation, neonates are bagged with self/flow inflating bags to achieve adequate chest rise, heart rate > 100 per minute and a pink color. When positive pressure ventilation is delivered with a bag, tidal volume is not measured. It is likely that high tidal volume is delivered to the neonate in order to achieve a rapid response. The evidence from human and animal model studies suggests that the initiation of mechanical ventilation and volutrauma associated with continued ventilation, are associated with an increase in pro-inflammatory mediators in the lungs of the preterm infants which induce pulmonary injury. This may interfere with the signaling involved in alveolarization, leading to a decrease in alveolar formation or maldevelopment of the alveoli, and subsequent evolution to chronic lung disease (CLD) or bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD).~OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and feasibility of controlling tidal volume delivery (and limiting manual ventilation), during the resuscitation of preterm infants < 28 weeks' gestation.~STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: A randomized controlled pilot study of 40 preterm neonates at the Mount Sinai Hospital.~RESEARCH PLAN: All eligible parents at risk for preterm delivery at < 28 weeks' gestation will be approached. After obtaining written informed consent, infants will be randomized to standard resuscitation according to NRP guidelines (control group) or resuscitation using controlled tidal volume ventilation (5 ml/kg) (study group), if they require resuscitation. Crossover to the control group will be allowed if there is clinical deterioration or no clinical improvement after 3 minutes of intervention.~OUTCOMES:~Primary: Apgar scores at 5,10, 15 and 20 minutes and pH, pO2, and pCO2 levels within 1 hour of resuscitation and at 4 hours of life.~Secondary: Durations of mechanical ventilation, continuous positive airway pressure support, low flow oxygen/air requirement; respiratory status of infant at 28 days postnatal and 36 weeks' corrected gestational age. Incidences of air leak, intraventricular haemorrhage and all causes of mortality before discharge from NICU will be compared.\"},\n",

The IVC then returns blood back to the heart. An IVC filter is placed to help prevent the blood clots moving from the legs to the heart or lung. The idea behind using a filter in the IVC is to capture potential fatal pulmonary emboli at an anatomical location where they may pose less risk for the patient. Early filters, 1960's and 70's were, remained in the vein permanently. More recently, temporary or retrievable filters have been developed and are being widely used.~Complications have been demonstrated with long-term placement of IVC filters. In a randomised study it was found that that patients with IVC filter placement had greater than three times the incidence of recurrent deep vein thrombosis (DVT) compared to their control population at two years. Blockage of the vein, recurrent pulmonary emboli, filter penetration and filter fragmentation have all been described.~With the advent of retrievable filters (filters that can be place temporarily and then removed at a later date) there has been renewed popularity for placement of temporary filters. To our knowledge, no one has yet to follow the population of intended temporary IVC filters, who undergo failed retrieval, and consequently end up with a permanent IVC filter.~We plan to prospectively enrol 40 Alfred patients who have undergone a temporary IVC filter placement and subsequently have had failed IVC filter retrieval.~Our aim is to evaluate the long term outcomes for patients with failed IVC retrieval.~Specifically we will determine the risk, due to failed filter retrieval, of:~IVC stenosis~IVC occlusion~Development of DVT and~analyse the clinical outcomes (symptoms), their prevalence and their distribution~Patients will receive routine care and their data will be analysed annually as collected. The follow-up period is indefinite and will be at the discretion of the treating doctor.\"},\n",

The study population will be implemented in Pee Dee region of the state of South Carolina and will include primarily low-income women who seek care at selected primary health care clinics in the region.~In this study, all women 18 and older receiving care at selected primary care clinics will be offered screening for IPV annually. Clinicians will use a structured screening tool to assess physical, sexual, and psychological IPV in a current relationship (IPV+) or IPV experienced by the woman in the past five years (Recent IPV). Clinics will be randomly assigned to implement a clinic-based intervention for women who screen positive for current or recent IPV. Two interventions will be implemented using a factorial design. In the Empowerment-Focused Patient Education Intervention, clinicians will conduct a 7-session intervention focusing on the health and well-being of the woman and attempt to link women's IPV experience with their health. In the IPV Services Intervention, IPV Specialists who are trained advocates from the Pee Dee Coalition Against Domestic and Sexual Assault (PDC) will be based in the clinic to (a) counsel women about IPV including safety planning, (b) provide linkages to PDC services, and (c) link women to clinic-based support groups developed specifically for this project.~We hypothesize the intervention(s) will change (a) clinician screening, referral, and IPV documentation patterns, (b) clinician IPV knowledge and perceived skills in working with women who have experienced IPV and their children (c) women's help-seeking behaviors, risk of poor mental and physical health, and (d) women's risk of subsequent IPV victimization. To evaluate these outcomes, we will survey clinicians and prospectively follow a group of consenting IPV+ women (N=300 in each intervention arm) to assess changes in their help-seeking, health behavior and status, IPV experience over two-years of follow-up.\"},\n",

Patients who need a lot to stay asleep get more, and those who need less get less. As a result, patients tend to wake up faster with BIS monitoring as compared to standard practice not using BIS. Little is known about the long-term effects of BIS monitoring. This study investigates whether BIS monitoring during anesthesia improves long-term outcome, well after surgery is over. The hypothesis is that it does. Two groups of patients are compared: one in which BIS monitoring was used, and one in which it was not. Groups are compared on tests of memory, concentration and mental well-being, to see if one does and feels better than the other. The investigators also take blood samples to see how well patients' bodies deal with the surgery. The investigators expect the BIS monitoring group to do better.\"},\n",

       "  'brief_summary': 'Problem of Interest:~A typical American diet that is high in an intake of fats (especially saturated fats and cholesterol) is known to lead to high blood levels of cholesterol, hardening of the arteries, and increases the risk of heart disease. The American Heart Association recommendations to follow a diet that is low in the amount of fat, and specifically cholesterol, that is eaten can improve blood levels of cholesterol but can lead to a high intake of sugars (especially processed sugars) that can lead to obesity and continued heart problems.~Studies of people who eat a diet that is typical of the Mediterranean region have shown that this type of diet leads to reductions in heart disease as well as forms of cancer. A typical Mediterranean diet has a large amount of fruit, vegetables, whole grain breads and cereals, beans, potatoes and seeds. Olive oil is the main source of fat and there is a daily use of dairy products (such as cheese and yogurt) in low to moderate amounts. The main meats are fish or poultry with rare red meat. Desserts are usually fruits with rare sweets. Wine is also used in low to moderate amounts with meals.~No isolated aspect of the diet explains all of its benefits, but it is believed that the ingredient of the diet that most helps to reduce the risk of heart disease is the high amount of omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids are found in fatty fish as well as in nuts and certain oils. Several studies of patients with either known heart disease or risk factors for heart disease have shown a reduction in heart disease events, such as heart attacks, as well as markers of heart disease risk when patients followed a Mediterranean diet. Other studies have shown that giving a supplement that contains omega-3 fatty acids to patients with heart disease or risk factors for heart disease also reduces heart disease events and markers of heart disease risk.~In this current study we, the investigators at Emory University, plan to compare the effects of following a Mediterranean diet versus continuing to follow an American type diet and supplementing parts of the Mediterranean diet, including omega-3 fatty acids, on markers of heart disease risk. A third group will continue to follow their usual diet without supplements to serve as a control.~How Problem Will be Studied:~In this initial study we will compare three groups. One group will receive one month of prepared meals that will follow a Mediterranean diet. This group will also receive extensive counseling and education on how to maintain a Mediterranean diet. During the second month of the study this group will be encouraged to continue following a Mediterranean diet by themselves with assistance from a nutritionist. The second group will be asked to continue on their current diet and receive supplements that are important parts of the Mediterranean diet. These supplements will include an omega-3 fatty acid capsule, walnuts and grape juice. A third group will be asked to continue their current diet and level of activity without supplements to serve as a control. We will follow the effects on markers of heart disease risk. We will also determine if patients are able to continue following a Mediterranean diet on their own or whether simply taking supplements is easier.~Advancement in Scientific Knowledge:~This study will advance scientific knowledge by comparing the effects of following a Mediterranean diet versus simply taking supplements of the believed to be important aspects of the Mediterranean diet. We will also be able to determine if it is easier to follow a Mediterranean diet or take supplements for patients who are currently ingesting a typical American diet.~Standard of Care:~Currently the recommended diet for all Americans is a Step 1 American Heart Association diet that is low in fat and specifically low in saturated fats and cholesterol. As stated above, despite these recommendations, there is a growing problem of obesity in the United States and there is evidence to suggest that a Mediterranean diet may be better.'},\n",

Heparin is always given to patients undergoing open-heart surgery to prevent blood from clotting when a patient is placed on the heart-lung machine.

The protein that heparin combines with seems to be different in infants and young children compared to adults.~The purpose of this study is to determine which proteins in children have a direct impact on the way heparin works. We also want to see how this may change at different ages. We will enroll two age groups of children; birth to 2 years and 10 years or older. A total of 125 patients will be enrolled into this study. These patients will already be scheduled for open-heart surgery using a heart-lung machine.~The testing involves taking blood samples when the patient is asleep for surgery; and later from their intravenous line, IV.

Rejection medications require a delicate balance of enough medicine to work without causing side effects. It is a goal to avoid both rejection and side effects from the anti-rejection medicines. Usually several medicines are used together to prevent rejection. One of these medicines is often Mycophenolic Acid or CellceptThis medicine has been used longer for adults than is has for children. More information is needed on using it for children. The dose is usually determined by the patient's weight or body surface area.~There have been some early studies of the use of Cellcept, but none have proven a relationship between the blood level of the drug and how well it works. More also needs to be known about how this drug works with other anti-rejection drugs and how it works in boys and girls. This study will look more closely at proper dosing, how Cellcept works with other anti-rejection medications, side effects, and any differences in how this medicine works in boys and girls.~All patients in the study will be receiving Cellcept and have blood levels of the drug drawn.

The initial phase of the proposed work will use an iterative engineering design - modeling - evaluation process to develop variable compliance elements and an industry standard pylon mount adapter. During the second phase of the proposed work, clinical evaluations of SFF prosthetic sockets will be studied. The effectiveness of variable compliant elements in enhancing comfort and fit will be determined using a within subject case comparison study of SFF sockets with conventional laminated sockets.
